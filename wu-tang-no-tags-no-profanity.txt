pants militant sawed up like linen, bobbing bonus pack
invest in the first b-boy kid show, life on skid row, with jive talking PROFANITY's
he wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly
and kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he?
is he in the backyard, or on your front porch
or standing in the corner of the club, with the blunt torched
you're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving
and sold odds and bob kins, to old PROFANITYs and goblins
valley, adjust a pest and your worst best friend
who mending with PROFANITYe time fabric like polyester blend

semi off the remy, mixed with henny, moet demi'
underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'
israeli issued, automatic black pistol

cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober
have you been drinking? breathe into the breathalyzer
get out the car, please, follow this exerciser
put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe
walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road
my PROFANITYmeboy kano, used to do the mashed PROFANITYato
on cartwheels, and then spin PROFANITYuse like whirled tornado
that used to chase the light, but, son, he will always save ya
becoming pump blows, and make beats inside my basement
drunk or sober, never lose your composure

if you can't understand, then come closer
we civilize the uncivilized cuz we supposed to
drunk or sober, never lose your composure
might give your hand, black man stand as a soldier
stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
if you can't understand, then come closer...

cause it's time for the beggaz to reign, remain

a vision my facility a death world trilogy (you see that PROFANITY)
now fictional plots speak out through gunshots
battles won and lost at the of heaven's throne
the sky rains blood drowning the earth with red mud
i be sitting on the edge of mars counting stars
finding me a place in PROFANITYe unchaseable
no mortal can't fulfill such skill they incapable
of keeping all the planets in-line with one mind
make the sun and moon both shine at one time
i orchestrate the guns that air for PROFANITY's sake
precipitate make rain, hail, snow and earthquake
levitate the gravitational pull of haleys comet
shake the chords of earth make a euro-volacanic PROFANITY
ebonic with sonic waves that blaze the human flesh
it flames extra-terrestrial it's time to reap professional
feel the untestable force burning your course
hints of visible thoughts be the source of begga sorcery

even though her leg was bitten
crackheads point the finger at detective slick morris PROFANITYtins

you squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
all slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
you sometime me, don't need to remind me about
livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
the PROFANITY PROFANITYldin the door, the mugging no one saw
we played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
and the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
small percentage determined to strengthen they position
transformation from critical to, stable condition
but it still be obstacles on PROFANITY that's optical
watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
the money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
with they pockets and fridge PROFANITY, many aim to take it
whether - PROFANITYld up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
and for some, another way out, is music and sports
that's why i, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
that won the championship, with just oh on the clock

i grew up on the crime side, the new york times side
stayin' alive was no jive
had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'lo goose
only way i be gettin' the g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this, son
rollin' with this one and that one
pullin' out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smokin' woolas at 16
and runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
makin' my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for PROFANITYs and PROFANITY
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
stickin' up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better, same PROFANITY 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
catchin' keys from 'cross seas
rollin' in mpv's, every week we made forty g's
yo, PROFANITY, respect mine, or here go the tec-9
ch-chick-pow! move from the gate now!

cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all
cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all

it's been twenty-two long hard years, i'm still strugglin'
survival got me buggin', but i'm alive on arrival
i PROFANITYp at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause PROFANITY is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed; i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
tryin' to get a clutch at what i could not
the court played me short, now i face incarceration
pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turned i learned life is PROFANITY
livin' in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes givin' chase
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed, and i ask: what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and PROFANITY rocks
and stray shots, all on the block that stays PROFANITYt

but vevorine, had a special friend called PROFANITY
she told me, that's PROFANITYw she met ray charles and marvin PROFANITYe
but back then, i ain't gon' front, i was peddling 'caine

cause it's a poor man's girl, and i will never give love
to PROFANITYw fast PROFANITYe, that's low as PROFANITY was
martin had a dream, PROFANITY, i did too
to make it out the PROFANITYod, rich, PROFANITY, off that stoup
so, i took it that thaw, and hit the street
with bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
momma said, never get high on your own supply
especially if you plan to leave this PROFANITYod PROFANITY rich
reminiscing on my past, PROFANITY it brings me to tears
see the more money that comes in, the more i disappear

watch this PROFANITY, make me back it up, d'angelo knows the feeling
off that needles warm embrace, in a PROFANITY heeling
this tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the

baby, you gotta trust me, cause i gotta girl and you got a man
i don't want you to judge me, i just wanna be your friend
baby, you gotta trust me...

aiyo i live by the rules, trust nothing in skirts
cause with that big PROFANITY and a smile, she be waiting to flirt
with a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt
another PROFANITY in the jaw, more dick in the george
while you PROFANITYme sleeping, she creeping, you thinking it's yours
that's just PROFANITYw women is, i reminisce
on when i had to learn from experience, why they call you a PROFANITY
and i ain't the best, but i ain't never denied

time for royalty audit
fabulous establishment metabolism, blackfoot indian
cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
then grew to a physical PROFANITYy with five meridians
as the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
i got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
and politic with leo and russell
when PROFANITY is still rushin we'll brush you

he's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives


thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
ignite, blowin the mic to arabian heights
as i recite this medley, PROFANITY couldn't PROFANITY with the
deadly ground i PROFANITYld down
classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
panic and confusion echoes through the building
continuing to build, i strive for perfection
driven by the will to live, glocks i PROFANITYld
shots i give, while searchers of rescue teams
look for means of survival and who's liable
for this harrowing experience
you scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
and proceeds of the wu-tang academy
to PROFANITY up your anatomy with PROFANITYault and battery

"it has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose..somewhere in outer PROFANITYe."

"the mysteries of creation are there."

"up in the sky?" "up in the sky."

and new PROFANITYpes for knowledge and peace are there.
and therefore as we set sail; we ask PROFANITY's blessing -
on the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure
of which man has ever embarked."

"prepared for liftoff."

i self lord and master, shall bring disaster to evil factors
demonic chapters, shall be captured by kings
through the storms of days after
unto the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
the brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
word to the father, and mother earth
seeking everlasting life through this PROFANITY for what it's worth
look listen and observe
and watch another c-cypher pullin my PROFANITYps to the curb
heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
the righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
cannot afford to be confined to a cell
brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers little daddy street preacher
illustrious feature, narrator you select
accompanied by deck plus the dj you respect
the seven and a half combine, over the frontline
the ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
infinite skills create miracles
warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, PROFANITYldin it down

yeah; i leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
wild like rock stars who smash guitars
poison bars from the PROFANITYs bust PROFANITYles in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
invade your zone, ruin like ancient rome
i span the universe and return to earth to claim my throne
the maker, owner, plus soul controller
ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
stand like collossus, regardless to whom or what
numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
who but us, to supply you with the fire?
the burning truth, 150 absolut proof
on the mic like moses spoke in golden scribe
survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
i notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
sound the PROFANITYrn; we come PROFANITYblin through the function
precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
when we die hard, to build the monument to PROFANITYnor us with
humungous effect in the world - we could have conquered it

drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on sunday?
while the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
all those who couldn't multiply were sent back
no tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
brought to a halt from a front full PROFANITYault
the chemist left the lab with undetermined results
they saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
the audience threw nuts with loose PROFANITYs and bolts
the archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes

taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated
blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
exaggerated authorization, food and drug administration
testin poison in prison population
my occupation to stop the innauguration of satan
some claim that it was reagan, so i come to slay men
like bartholemew, cause every particle is physical article
was diabolical to the last visible molecule
a PROFANITYe night like rom, consume planets like unicron
blasting photon bombs from the arm like galvatron

(hey, rakeem!) what? (your little brother got shot!)
i ran frantically, then i dropped down to his feet

i'ma keep pushin the trigger 'til ya head is back

yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
make it brief son, half short and twice strong
no doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
it was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
lace mc's with styles when they rhyme PROFANITY
on a label PROFANITYt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
eight diagram sword swinga armored tank force
rza throw in the disc but then change the bank source
you can't flow, must be the speech impediment
you got lost off the snare off impeach the president
whether in amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
this witty unpredictable shot is critical
to PROFANITYytical analogy, insurance policies why
said he know that sounds define the note
couldn't recognize, blast him the PROFANITY behind the ropes
too many dope PROFANITY i see starvin
catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
a fugitive bass playin rap czar
smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar



tical got a PROFANITYld on ya, doin exactly
what the PROFANITY i mariju-wanta, dis PROFANITY nasty
deep in the PROFANITY dungeon, buggin, lovin
the ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya

captivated by a saga that go untold, like goldfinger
caught up in a cliffhanger
yo i-n-s another code red, danger, break out the vest
now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
come with your shield and hardware, it be on here

and so as bobby...
and so as bobby...
and so as bobby start to learn more jewels of life
he became more the wiser, and the rza was being manifested from within
for a new embryo, had been born through the cypher
bringin' forth into existence, the ruler zig-zag-zig allah
and he started to spit PROFANITY like this

yo, happy new year, throw on your wu-wear
we true here, you crab derelict PROFANITY, you can't push through here
the ice melter, you best to to PROFANITYe for ya shelter
this a sign, when it's called alpha phi sigma phi delta
digi tech, 36 tech, eject pelet
rip through rap cadet, no one left to tell it
then them PROFANITYok, walked through justice in brooks
scotch whiskey, in the middle of patty, with four glocks wit me
hand pull trigger PROFANITY, 16-shot dart spitta

for industriliazed rapped capatilist, trynna PROFANITY a PROFANITY of this
bza PROFANITY, please don't make me flip, flip, flip, flip

and bones get sparked, my wiz as strong as joan of arc

while ya dogs just bark, bark, bark
we spread this attitude, to every point of latitude
every street crevest, every quarter, every avenue
i might be on the iffel, wit a 30/30 scope riffler
ready to snipe you, and wipe you from the face of the earth
you can taste it PROFANITYerse, the blood thirst
i start to bring the great flood, first, first, first

so as his mind start to grow
he start expression himself through his hip PROFANITYp culture
changin' his thoughts, standin' on his truth of square

build it better himself to those around him
and he start talkin like this...
hungry men have no respect for law or authority
or human life, a man's bread and PROFANITYer is only
insured if he works for it
leadership means everything, pain, blood and death
what night is to day, man is to woman
and woman is to man, fear is the state of nervousness
only fit for children, not men
all men are created equal, so to offend man, is to offend PROFANITY
fear is lose control of one third, if you become like a helpless deer
or a feathless bird, we stand as the true of living, living true
and these jewels, thoughts of great wise men, like marcus garvey
start to build up inside bobby's head
and it lead him to the knowledge of himself
and he became a strong PROFANITYfucka!
"peace PROFANITY"

age of poems and poetry, old sloans
explosive head bullets, black PROFANITYoded
invalid footed ninjas, who full metal jacket clips
and know PROFANITYw to put it in you
surrender your goods and your merchandise
for no purchase price, i'm certainly a heist
for your ice and curtains and vice
come quietly, wu-tang clan rules society
because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
and lead them to defy me, diary...
i need 18 points for my next joint
this high and mointed king, to make a deal
i be the one to appoint, steve ripken must have been sniffing
to catch something so dope, it left minor c-lits PROFANITY dripping
i PROFANITY PROFANITYdreds of PROFANITY, and split millions of dollars
and built with thousands of scholars
my life saga from the hildred of PROFANITYror
legal kid brown in nicaragua
gave birth to mc's, seeds and bank robbers
we drove with pistol whips into world-wide trips
and my PROFANITY's been PROFANITY by the finest lips
stand to tell the contestants, in the world's best repressment
but none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
or my queen and my seeds, in the PROFANITYme that i rest in
enter my dome get blown to 99 sections

this rhyme has no limitations, this time there's no hesitation
collecting minds at the door, you want it PROFANITY it's yours
the flavors raw, what the PROFANITY think i'm flowing for
it's rhyme and reason, bite the bullet
niggaz is foul in this duck season
we add odds till we even PROFANITY
bad PROFANITY, high times, lower classes
taste mine, straight shots in PROFANITY glasses
bring it to him, room service, under pressure
and mad nervous, waving guns at the clergy
ticallion, we ain't worried
keep them sick PROFANITY seven-thirty
picture this, watch the birdy
this PROFANITY is rolling PROFANITY
with sharp pins that be stabbing you
pins and needles, needles and pins
nuff said, PROFANITY in your mouth
like PROFANITY was bled, as i race track with thoroughbreds
ducking the feds

yo, my ice slow fly up on the keyboard son
niggaz ran up on me law, praising what we do by the lords
that's right, exile the fake, hit them PROFANITY like weight
feed a fool, let the fake evaporate
reconstruction, that's the whole science of mine
production, ya'll PROFANITY guess who stuck son

(y'all PROFANITY know..
the next chamber's the PROFANITY' weather)
look out for the stingers, bab
yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
for all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

yo, in the PROFANITYusing, thousands seen early graves
victims of wordly ways, memories stays engraved
all my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
the young PROFANITYger, blind to these lies, they die younger
in this new world the order slaughter men, women, and children
ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
the projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the PROFANITYble
streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
vivid thoughts, devils resort to trick knowledge
they kick garbage, PROFANITY for chicks and quick dollars
i know the pain the game bring, i did the same thing
spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
it's hard to keep control, i bless those who seek a scroll
trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper PROFANITYld
not a role model, i walk a hard road to follow
i sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
the gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
their life and times, deadly like the virus design
but too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way

a voice cries from the wilderness of the north
a representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
or other PROFANITYisions of the family structure
youths are injected with serums that leads
to skin irritations, babies being born with
disfigurations, experimentations
on their faces there bear world relations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
it lightly begins to rain screams of terror
are hidden by the passing trains
this can't be little hussein, his uncle cried
as he drops to his nephew's side, PROFANITYlding his cane
just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
bitter sickness, and left us to witness

yeah, yo
curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
soothe in PROFANITYly ways, hands, solemn in praise
tree of life, more precious than wu is golden game
the wise self flourish inherit, halls of fame
crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
while we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
blow, spin, and sin and PROFANITYing what's revealing
it's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
zero process, progress, become the PROFANITYted
america's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
some love the speed, some satisfy a need
some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
the strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
one flew astray, and then caught my little seed
can it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife
the righteous man would be within these PROFANITYes pipes
take in my energy, breath and know the rest
cause the good die young and the hard die best

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way

y'all PROFANITY love dances, and pulling down your pants
while your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
your friends ain't PROFANITY, all they do is drink, smoke, and PROFANITY PROFANITY
the whole projects is trapped in stench
you either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
fifteen years old, shorty PROFANITY and top out
ninety-nine cent beer drinking PROFANITY stinking
fucking so much your PROFANITY and PROFANITY start shrinking
new world order PROFANITY trade, minimum wage, medicaid
can a devil fool a muslim nowadays
inside my lab, i'm going mad
took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
the blue is for the crips, the red is for the bloods
the whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
early light, why is sons fighting for the PROFANITYe

as we dwell through this concrete PROFANITY, calling it PROFANITYme
mama say, take your time young man and build your own
don't wind up like your old dad
still searching for them glory days he never had
so many bad want to scheme for american dream, no more kings
the cash rule everything now, we going down
these babies looking up to us, it's up to us
the million man march mc's, get on the bus
but envy, greed, PROFANITY, and hate, separate
though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
no longer, brothers, we unstable
like kane when he slew abel, PROFANITYing each other

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
black knights
west coast PROFANITYa bee kill
black knights, black knights
you hear it from the distance

(yo) my brain sprouts branches blossoming tragic thoughts
takes bully lyrics lunch money, pistols or microphone
welcome to l.a. battle the unexplained
scarecrows and apples meet mr. constrictus
concrete knuckles and scuffles, i waste groups
give 'em lumps the size of footballs, bricks and grapefruit
make soup, blueberry while dining with classic monsters
better check my sponsor chop before you can answer
brothers in the contra, bullet PROFANITYles in the stop sign
gods in the neighborhood, pistol in the sunset
lyrics, the PROFANITY pressed dump trucks with one PROFANITY
faster than sound, light, or speed that your gun busts
among us, west coast wreck PROFANITYpes, infect dope
whining 'cause your last PROFANITYlocaust cassette broke
the PROFANITYchback tic-tac heads come to get you
nine-hundred and forty-three missiles made of crystal
light a match to those, the crowd put all their lighters up
stomp through the graveyard in the rain, the architect
bricks in the mud, the cold weather is scorchin
for boxcar children and orphans, wrote a portrait
chewing on cactus, rappers better practice
slimey like a catfish, dollers in the mattress
a hand-carved pipe from baton rouge to cherokee
grand-high count, feed macadamias to parakeets
french lemonade, skeletons on the highway
clove, gets rowdy i'll box my way out
poor righteous teacher, devils better fear us
or my pistol splatter your brains accross the mirrors

bluntz, martinez, girls, and gunz (gunz)

gut 'em like a fish, the man who bled marbles
bloody mr. fixit, PROFANITYlocaust and guns
stumbled through the doorway wearing my evening chains
real as the hallway red and blue crayolas
now leaving stains, architect from cali
rumble through the mist covered valleys, PROFANITY alleys
crumbs in your suitcase, ice fishing with pelicans
big 'ole tackling skeleton, you're irrelevant
riding jeweled elephants, california PROFANITYrizon
track mud through the kitchen, PROFANITY henchmen
strange man's pockets, cigarettes and candy
walk with a limp, chance of a lifetime
bandits want cyborg crank, tic-tac
blow PROFANITYles through emcees, size of bowling PROFANITY
briefcase man chant, my flavor's building
set a fishbowl full of jelly beans out for the neighbor's children
two-fisted brawler, good times in the sunlight
tracked him one night, you call and cause a gunfight
holo-holocaust is sleepy, PROFANITYldin microphones
4 dead men in the alley, the butcher
shirts with the blossoms, west coast the gentlemen
holding the pistol, smoke blunts for PROFANITYurs
to understand the language of flowers
gritty mugshot, missed her arms and legs, drool bullets
bedtime time to turn in but into what?
a well set table, third rock from the sun
dead men PROFANITYg, cadillacs and dinosaurs
hot peanuts and fireworks, the PROFANITYlocaust

bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz girlz and gunz girlz and gunz

bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz

while one flashed metal, eight calculate position
the world snapped, once we combined our rap
drastic measures, priceless treasures on nap'
our swords swing, windchill mount aerie
native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
snares and kicks, off the project bricks
it's no act the PROFANITYucer played the role with drumsticks
the warning came unnoticed, it's like the shot "on the dock of the bay"
that slayed otis, the nine-lotus
each one adjust to his own environment
formulate this great lp, a PROFANITYdred rounds spent
niggas bent on a fruitless search for nourishment
they long for this proper guidance encouragement

foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this PROFANITYuction

mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness

let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
witness, forget his, original statement
even in protection programs there's no escapement
gunned down, we in town, hit king from seven crowns
spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the zebra lounge
wounded, back in the eighty-three summer heat
up in three-oh-nine park, rhymin off the drummer's beat
i stalk the city streets demonstratin mic wrecks
all lookin stank, i ain't playin wit a full deck
and as they nervously stare, i know they scared
they saw the coming of wu, the neon in times square
household name, PROFANITYassin, PROFANITYa bee
mill to the grain, that posess the wu, trilogy
quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
those that got styles, they got identical twins
don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finnicky
without skills, they master the art of mimicry
but i go line for line on the whole page
your unspotted life on the mic is old age

ladies and gentlemen: sunz of man

army suits PROFANITYed and timbs
you'se a friend, PROFANITY a gem

i spent a lifetime of doin crime, hustlin dimes, guzzlin wine
smugglin wives, one of a kind
under the sunshine, movin as one mind, the genuine
star child, allah's style, many say their barber's wild
when i element the foul, prowl, upon the weekend of sweet
i gotta eat, generate with the heat, demolish beats
collectin sheets, war with beast, islamic warrior
livin the mass hysteria, the bomb shell of america
swell competors, explicit lyrics from the editor
realistic predator, the rhyme writer, climb heights
rhymes ignite, mc's reputation, blown out of sight
on the mic device, my crew get nice, shoot dice
doin callistetics, young diplomatics with automatics
the asiatic, PROFANITY a fanatic, i split his attic
you don't want no static, i make you carriage for the rabbits


we've got to take what we want, let these others rappers front

fuck opinions, i'm hittin to the nights endin
a new beginin, takin over men and women
thoughts used for sinnin, neighborhood no grinin
thug religions, expeditions, startin for a mil
stick the student for his intuition
beyond college, street knowledge, got to eat knowledge
off the tree of life, while seek wallets
credit cards, some trust for their PROFANITYs
in the wizard of oz, you get it all to get robbed
price is on the food and the earth's precious jewels
ain't the golden rules from the golden black jewels
steppin out the furnace, only run with fast learners
burn cash and we stash burners

major league, total PROFANITYassinator, rhyme complicator
the devil and the sword bring death, feed jamaica
rain or hurricane, step on my PROFANITYuse

cobwebs out of your mind

i can't go to sleep, i can't shut my eyes
they shot the father at his mom's building seven times
they shot malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
jesse watched as they shot king on the balcony
exported marcus garvey cause he tried to spark us
with the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
oh jacqueline you heard the rifle shots PROFANITYling
her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
america's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
what's the science? somebody? this is trick knowledge
they try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
walking through park hill, PROFANITY as a PROFANITY
looking around like these devils
i'm ready to break this world down
they got me trapped up in a metal gate
just stressed out with hate
and just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
what should i do, grab a blunt or a brew
grab a .22 and run out there and put this PROFANITY violence in you
i can't go to sleep, i can't shut em, son, i..

don't let the game make you lose your head
you should be calling the shots instead
the power is in your hands
stop all this crying and be a man
yo, yo, yo, yo
vendetta inside, swiftly start stabbin
one second to meltdown, feel the twin cannons
burn, handgun herns, standin firm
return from mega-death, i'll tell you what's left
dilemma, earth tremor, up by man
with the grand canyon rap, u dynamic wingspan
the power from the clan, yo, is more than fantastic
pull pins out the hazard, on this battlestar galactic'
skull tactic, sporatic, asiatic, long awaited
son of sam, mention the mic mutated
you hated us, cuz we immortal on wax
rip the china white PROFANITY, flip a dynamite ax
shillac em perhaps, the heart pump an anti-toxin

intellect reflects worldwide over internets
heart colder than winter fresh, chest smokin like incense
vets broken into the flesh, soakin in ya own mess
chrome bleds, some of the known best soldier vets

with grief fallin on me in a breeze, the seas partin
it's two men awesome, uncanny
the handy man crook, the rap gank where every PROFANITY nook and cranny
plus four more opponents couldn't throw me, couldn't slam me
i told you before, this is war, it's radical claw
menate the the law, practice my ambition
understand determination, plus my burnin condition
rebuild 'em, sing a song strong for disaster
scorch 'em on a letter, clever, bled 'em much faster
exotic lens, bionic timb's, hardco' PROFANITYic
the floor panic when revolvin, shaolin dodgin
potion of my juice, it's "houston we have a problem"
its basic instinct, motor mouth, PROFANITYld is sacred
the rushmore rock face, one four shot with the greatness
raw shoulders, sword colder, no remorse
the crash course, the portions of my porsche
divorse it, the PROFANITYlocaust exhaust, driven with force
mighty ship back on course, i almost lost it
toss the smokin corpse, seldom sing
shells amongst men, rebellion, teens formin and swarmin
vikin style, strikin without warnin a nation
standin ovation, rap devastation
new animation, the scandal
bandle the best part, damsel in distress, i'll bless you
god PROFANITY you! to the rescue

professional vets, now comin through vexed

shots from shaolin that go to masapeaqua

things'll never be the same, after this one
ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
recognize the PROFANITYs came, for one accord
for one mind and one cause, that's the PROFANITY son
play them crows out position
you might hear me but you don't listen
competition come and get some on
red marker still bleedin, through the paper
of his sick premeditated, PROFANITY caper

i walk with the shaolin strut, burn a dutch
watch street eat em up, cold crush, PROFANITYrush
spot rusher get touched backed up handcuffed
y'all PROFANITY can't PROFANITY with us

pass me the black velvet embassy suite PROFANITYin me
spell it PROFANITY priest caught me in the days up on delancy street
stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
it's like the dreads worshipin jah, so ha-lo-ha
pineapple crushed 850 swerve it with a rush
plush the canola range spittin off the roof, PROFANITYldin my change
yo it's ragtime, universal 12 monkey mind

the undervolt staten new york
it's the burner shaolin bound facedown you gets PROFANITYed
roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through midair
landin PROFANITYs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
keeps the iron, where the head rest, for the conquest
subway, wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
matched up in a staircase, in a dark place embraced
by the trey-eight, i'm in so deep i can't escape
these crime situations, i stay in man formation
and shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
p.l.o., slam cats like bam bam, bigolo
throw a flow like nomo relate like fidel castro
i be the great all pro, hangin mc's by they logos
my street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno
"you will be punished (wu-tang style)
for all your evil deeds. (wu-tang style)
be warned - you will suffer.. (wu-tang style)
.. justice!" (wu-tang style)

slept on this hazardous enterprise
hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
week self-captivity became months
those who were PROFANITYldin it down they hold a pump
do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
got a mass of starvin PROFANITY wanna eat supper
unfair corruptions lead to abductions
creatin wider circles of destructions
so we attack, with the pen and blaze in
from the terrifyin to the fascinating
quick to slay a narrow minded PROFANITY that's hasty to give credit
full of PROFANITYstile overtones mixed with wack edits
they heavily defended airfields
but they PROFANITYies rot behind punctured steels
when i greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
oh that water was my liquid of choice
forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
powerful projection, noise is deafening
carrier battle groups, that's threatening
higher level bombing, plus
the shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
in the same crucial manner but different style

(wu-tang style, wu-tang style!)

yeah..
aiyyo once again, all blunts again

gun out blaow, wow the PROFANITY's wild when you short us

i miss you in the game a court summons
and fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
e'rything was wack 'til we popped up
and got it on and poppin like orville reddenbacher
potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
wu-tang got ya, like every ghetto got a tasha
request lines are now open, you see these mc's chokin

to critic what i write, that's my muh'fuckin word
blah blah blah, like n'sync
kiss that PROFANITY "bye bye bye" knahmsayin?  i ain't playin

many shall come, few chose to stay exact
track after track i'm fightin for survival
before me i see hills and mountains they sway
the words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
i walk water PROFANITYldin y'all suspended with the vocal
what's the total people that came to see the PROFANITYs?
i gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
potentcy, high-level content
side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
all ages streets to cages, split faces
shoutin nuff love to the PROFANITYps from miami

murdered in PROFANITYmicides, i just couldn't let it slide
fuck money, jury and bein' a rap star
i PROFANITYped out shootin', soon as my PROFANITY stopped the car

"the wu-tang clan will rise again
there are many of us, working for the good of the wu tang"



so get your egg crashed, by my PROFANITYz wind staff
while the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
like kaity chung, PROFANITYw the bullet collapsed his lung
his father watched the PROFANITYrror as he swallowed his tongue
another youth dead, before the age of twenty-one
left his son to grow, in the ghettos of the slums
with a shot that go, for twisted metal for cash flow
react slow PROFANITY and get, p.l.o.
by the lone gunner, who took revenge for his brother
who got slain last summer by a PROFANITY runner
a new year is dawning, new crews is forming
rival gangs warring blood steadily pouring
the streets are deep son every day is like a rerun
so i reach out and try to teach one
but eighty-five percent uncivilized content
no tolerance so a lifetime is spent
behind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench
killer instinct PROFANITY rap PROFANITY get lynched



so yo break that PROFANITY arm fast as a PROFANITY
tell ra, goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
to all you slow footed penguins, ducking from these
hot rocks that's flaming, chocolate for all you rap damian's
spraying cards espionage, dodgeball square hard
strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
and a mink in, next album 'blood on chef's apron'
keep a gambino playstation in your playpen
discovery channel, cats that book at daniel
coke blunts PROFANITYt as a PROFANITY swatted bamboo

hit you close range with this madness
unique design shine like a deep dish
the beat kick technique split all your weak PROFANITY

living legend, veteran known to set trend
lethal weapon, step through your section
with the force like luke skywalker
rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
live performer, bit the mic sayanora

tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
i got my sword cross your throat you joke

times of blackness eclipsing the sun, target practice
commence when i throw these darts at these rappers

hold me down, wu bloodkin, i'm going in
shootin bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
blend like a chameleon

blowing backs in cold
blunted non-assassin, time for action, johnny unidas
handle that like arthritis
still, PROFANITYld a golden touch like king midas



drownin' problems in heinekens imported from PROFANITYlland
gettin boosted off a PROFANITYer bee pollen,
stone columns get PROFANITYed by drum tracks
smack loud as gun loud as gun claps
pin a crab to death with a thousand thumb tacs
the wu sensai fold, it beez the wind ninja scroll
sole edged blade controls your inner pole
the fig loot, fruit from the forbidden tree root
i stay secluded in the chamber training new recruits
with fatal guillotine, the black PROFANITYoded team what it means
when bullets scream from the PROFANITYt glock like rock from a sling
("sometimes...") pushed through like george bush operation whoops
shots get popped on the block causing blood to gush.
from digital to PROFANITYog, the wu-wear camouflage
the entourage squad we stomping through zanzibar
like herds of cattle, rza plays the wall like a shadow
connect the brook to shaol like the varrazano narrow.

we snipe, artificial PROFANITY under street lights
street fights transform into wars with firearms
bullets storm PROFANITY start to swarm like rise on
dying on the same blocks when they exchange rocks
and hand cops flamed rocks

this goes out to all my cats in the projects
just livin it, still livin it
thru the rough times and the bad times,
the crimes, where was heaven
must be somewhere here, though, for real
i never seen the place
maybe some place you got when you die

an ordinary cat from outer projects, since i was younger though
mom raised her children, pops dipped a long time ago
in my mind i see flashbacks, i had no fancy clothes
skinny, PROFANITY, knotty head PROFANITY crying with a snotty nose
even though my father neglect, he pay the child support
hadn't seen him all these years, i hug his PROFANITY in court
always saying i'm comin to get you and i be waitin too
holiday and birthday presents was never comin through
remember at the age 13 i started smokin PROFANITY
hanging out with cats that was older, start to run the street
dropped out of high school selling drugs, impressin chicks
spent most my cheddar on gear, my man was buyin whips
new york, jamaican, miami PROFANITY, flooded PROFANITYia quick
cause signin work only if buying, prices was high as PROFANITY
remember when i first got hit, i seen the iron spit
50 cash bent in one corner bleeding where pellet hit
my man shawn, he held on strong
slug burn through his lower back side, PROFANITY his spine exit his arm
lost him twice on the PROFANITYspital table and when he died i cried my eyes out
i couldn't take it (damn PROFANITY), but the same things continued to happen
niggaz got bust, i'm a kid with a grown man's mind turning corrupt
playing innocent in front of my elders
i was running with them cats that be robbing too, i couldn't tell 'em
if my name was up in any type trouble, my moms would tell me
just like you brothers into some PROFANITY go get a job or something
just a little PROFANITY on the street, not working hard for nothing
scratch i made when i was pumpin, i'm here to offer somethin
making sure the crib stay tight, for real i wasn't no PROFANITY
tell me where you getting this money, i wash a car be lying
saying anything 'sides drugs selling, my sister seen me on the block
transact' with fiends, be saying i'ma tell it
growing up was PROFANITY no doubt, i wonder where was heaven


shit, it's like yesterday, you know?
it all comes back though, but still
but still livin on the block, but still PROFANITY up
you know? crime affiliated, crime syndicate
whatever you wanna call it
you know what i'm sayin? affiliated with the bad PROFANITY
all the time just cuz i'm a victim of the projects

now i'm a grown man, still it's like life dealt me the wrong hand
cat's that was my man be frontin' or either found dead
sound said incarcerated just turned a new dad
remembering them long ten months from slingin PROFANITY bags
mom put me out with the quickness, carry your black PROFANITY
i'm still coming back to the crib, oh so you back? yeah
ma' i just came to PROFANITYller to see how you doing
nothing's changed after all these years
still hustle for some gear, smoke PROFANITY, still drink beers

now you should know - PROFANITYw neither of these herbs gassin' you
that would have you boosting clothes
left you hanging, dry and PROFANITY though
so know it's your turn, to play what you give for
your brain's looping slow, you PROFANITY PROFANITY
yeah, you should know, but the foolish don't
you don't get too close, cause you know the truth will show
runner ability, see, is something i went through before

yeah, yeah... i seen this movie before, it's weak
the plotline is very thin
yeah, it lacks substance, very predictible
i give it a thumbs down, i give it a thumbs down

see, i studied PROFANITYlogy since a young'n
so i spot every move, you make
i may not see it clearly through all the street talk
you got beef, walk, yeah i love you, but not like that
you try to stop my act, with your high for looting, childhood retribution
it won't rest til you get, your licks in
vixen victoria's secret stories, you keep within
your witch's brew, for due -- you
fancy as a, not too shroud, denial you choose
but your eyes on the glue, to your inner most
and, when i'm PROFANITYst to your bizarre sideshow, then expose for you

yeah, cause remember the wicked witch
when she looked in the mirror, and then the mirror just shattered and PROFANITY
cause she was so PROFANITY and PROFANITY... but ugly in the inside though
see you don't dig me, when i'm saying that
you gotta feel me, when i say, that that's the wicked witch

you seem lost so why would you try deviating
from what would seem to be, the clear choice to making
such a situation, such as this, now wake up
i play possible with you, but you gotta do what i say
but you gutter babe, through and through, you ain't have enough yet
pushing PROFANITY for PROFANITYuct, having a good time is what you call it
all of it, washed away the mourns of an alcoholic
now you out for my wallet, and give me a hard time too
just to show me a thing or two, about, PROFANITYw low the low be
well don't get cold feet, when you discover i PROFANITYld heat
to melt that cold heart, that's so weak

see, um, if you start, um, doing something PROFANITY around here
i'mma come out there and i will beat a PROFANITY PROFANITY
i will beat a PROFANITY down to the ground

and what's worst? when you're just fronting and faking
it's a shame when the sixteen bars are just a waste
and every line or word, is badly placed
even dealing with the narrow window of time

on a bunch of small puppets, with a wack PROFANITY team
that only move, at a push of a PROFANITYon that pull strings
bad boys move in silence, secretly fading in
unlike fake gangstas and ya wannabe made men

last night, i took a trip down to crown heights
fast life, females are trife, stay tight
i detect that parasite, satellite
rza beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
my slang sound write secretary type
backflip on the mic, i'm the poor black man
workin hard for the grand, i understand clear
don't fear, PROFANITYp my new gear it's different from yours
my style drop like jaws, you see me on tours
don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
wu article cappafive, cd attack
but my talk stage live PROFANITYa beehive
bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts
bring the gold dangle, never make me throw darts
check out my arts, when i release my smarts
hot like pop PROFANITYs, aim me at the charts
check it, these cold days got me in a physical rage
walking through the dark path in this invisible maze
my individual is criminal but lyrical plays
a big part in my life in this critical state
apocolypse, twist up the bamboo
swine life i cant handle
cock the mack candle, pop the jack daniels
im a shine like candles in a blackout

run for cover, pull a trigger, watch em all turn to dust
a ribbon in the sky, i watched his mom dukes cry
too bad her son had to die for startin up the two four five
guns never lie, chains like PROFANITYs go but heavy
down in my belly, attatched to my waist is a celly
for plannin funerals and gettin PROFANITY buried
i wanna lead this life but i can hear it callin me like r. kelly

shoeless shine like sunny days

create tracks that blow the hinges off the doors
thats all i can stands and i cant stands no more
whirlwind mind spins off seagrams gin

extreme measures got my thoughts on gettin pleasure
these cats know that i clap PROFANITYles through they leather
statens sick and we cant get no better
police trap, we get away too clever
lyrics jotted down on paper causes terror-
ism, now im gone hit em

damn we got to slow this PROFANITY down man, yaknowhatimean?

fiends were never waiting in the hill
they ran one step ahead
but the jiggy was always there

upon the project pavement
there was death, enslavement of the mind
single mothers are filled with stress

as i lay there with my baby
we would look, from the window, and cry
then suddenly in the sky

between the new world ages
we were blessed, and wu-tang fills the ear
with the melody of a train (lord is suddenly here!)

false mc's are melting
in the dark, all the weak lp's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn

god released the tape out, early may

and, i don't think the world can take it
cause it took so long to make it
and the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme

wu-tang, wu-tang, wu-tang

upon the project pavement
there was death, enslavement of the mind
single mothers are filled with stress

between the new world ages
we were blessed, and wu-tang fills the air
with the knowledge that PROFANITY posess

as i lay there with my baby
we would look, from the window, and cry
then the wu-tang sign appears, in the sky

billboards started melting
in the dark, all the weak mc's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwn

god released the tape of, earthly pain

and, i don't think the world can take it
cause it took so long to make it

for every cop we paid retired now the PROFANITY on smash
gash you out your burner fast
you swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass


yo what the PROFANITY yo?!  yo what the PROFANITY y'all comin for?
get the PROFANITY away from my door!
we got big guns in here, PROFANITY over there
with blue bag and e pills stashed under the chair
and there's boss PROFANITYg black and white pit with the pink lips
stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
the PROFANITY had me dyin yo, big fat PROFANITY bleedin
big cat PROFANITY all season
on the beach truck, stuck with hawaiian ice
diamond twice the whole city thought i bought fubu
blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
eighteen karat rap between noodles


up at PROFANITYa bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
i saw (?) sippin henny from a iced out cup
yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
i sit took, three drags off the PROFANITYney-dip
now what you talkin?  you see my gold fronts sparkin?
ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
read the headline, that was blast on today's post
dead king, thought he could ace ghost
queen, couldn't even jack monk
probably find him in doc doom's back trunk
bdoodoodoo!  i'm up at the wu library
readin malcolm's, ".. any means necessary"

john john, bacardi straight up PROFANITYld the ice
so nice like new york they had to name him twice
name your price, i black out then change the lights
give you the same advice that i gave my wife
don't PROFANITY with mine, clan give you lumps in nine
let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

new york, new york, legendary rhyme boss
code name charley PROFANITYrse, bust with blind force
i smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
you PROFANITY test, can't measure the threat
i dance on a PROFANITY like my name's zab judah
rap barracuda, three xl kahuna
sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
i'm thirstin, feel what i feel then we can merge then
creep it through the states in v8's and 12's
my weight's PROFANITY, PROFANITY with me then brace yourself
the PROFANITYle, sir i mass mogul
known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

this is grown man talkin, coward i split your head
i'm from the east where the streets run red from the bloodshed
hit chef for the rice and peas
nuff respect father e tumbled at ease
my brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
they need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
floatin on the 95, sting like a PROFANITYer bee
your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

from dark matter to the big crunch
the vocals came in a bunch without one punch
rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
so you compare contrast but don't blast
through extreme depths, with the pen i PROFANITYld fast
watch the block thirst for one became all
shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
the blind couldn't verify the authenticity
the rhyme came from the pressure of heat
then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets


these things just took over me
just took over my whole PROFANITYy
so i can't even see no more
i'm calling my black woman a PROFANITY
i'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not

save the children
they don't know who the true living PROFANITY is
and all the orchards in the world

so they worship what they know not
and let evil lead them in the wrong direction
far fewer men than right
now you got the ten percent
who are rich PROFANITY PROFANITY of the poor
who teach the poor lies
to make the people believe
that the old mighty true living PROFANITY
is a PROFANITY in the sky
save the children
and you can't see him with the physical eyes
they're also known as blood PROFANITYers of the poor
save the children
and then you got the five percent
who are the poor righteous people who do not believe
the teachers of the ten percent
save the children
who is all wise and know that the true
and living PROFANITY, and teach that the true
and living PROFANITY is supreme being black
man from within
otherwise known as civilized people
also muslims, and muslims sons
peace we out

we must expand, get more pupils
so that the knowledge will spreads

i smoke on the mic like smoking joe frazier
the PROFANITY raiser, raising hell with the flavor
terrorize the jam like troops in PROFANITYstan
swinging through your town like your neighborhood spiderman
so uhh, tic toc and keep ticking
while i get you flipping off the PROFANITY i'm kicking
the lone ranger, code red, danger!
deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
the vandal, too PROFANITYt to handle
you battle, you're saying goodbye like tevin campbell
roughneck, inspector deck's on the set
the rebel, i make more noise than heavy metal

the way i make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
rae got it going on pal, call me the rap PROFANITYassinator
rhymes rugged and built like schwarzenegger
and i'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
then take all your PROFANITYets
cause i came to shake the frame in half
with the thoughts that bomb, PROFANITY like math!
so if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
cause i grab the clip and
hit you with sixteen shots and more i got
going to war with the melting PROFANITY PROFANITYt

it's the PROFANITYod man for short mr. meth

i wanna break full, PROFANITY me back
small change, they putting shame in the game
i take aim and blow that PROFANITY out the frame
and like fame, my style'll live forever
niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better
but i do, true, can i get a "sue"
nuff respect due to the one-six-oh
i mean oh, you check out the flow
like the hudson or PROFANITY when i'm dusting
niggaz off because i'm PROFANITYt like sauce

oh, what, grab my nut get PROFANITY
ow, here comes my shaolin style
sloop, b. a. buh-b. y. u
to my crew with the "sue"


first things first man you're PROFANITY with the worst
i'll be sticking pins in your head like a PROFANITY nurse
i'll attack any PROFANITY who's slack in his mack
come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
shame on you when you stepped through to
the ol PROFANITY PROFANITY straight from the brooklyn zoo
and i'll be PROFANITY if i let any man
come to my center, you enter the winter
straight up and down that PROFANITY packed jam
you can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man
the ol PROFANITY PROFANITY is dirty and stinking
ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps
niggaz be rolling with a stash
ain't saying cash, bite my style i'll bite your PROFANITY PROFANITY!

for crying out loud my style is wild so book me
not long is PROFANITYw long that this rhyme took me
ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
here's mordigan, catch it like a PROFANITY flashback
i love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
i come with PROFANITY that's all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stomping grounds
i give a order to my PROFANITYps across the water
to go and PROFANITY up props all around the border
and get far like a shooting star
'cause who i am is dim in the light of pablo escobar
point blank as i kick the square biz
there it is you're PROFANITY with pros and there it goes

you chill with the feedback black we don't need that
it's ten o'clock PROFANITY, where the PROFANITY's your seed at?
feeling mad PROFANITYstile, ran the apostle
flowing like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the PROFANITYly roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
turn the other cheek and i'll break your PROFANITY chin
slaying boom-bangs like african drums (we'll be)
coming around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
my clan increase like black unemployment
yeah, another one dare,
tuh-took a genius (to) take us the PROFANITY outta here

the wu is too slamming for these cold PROFANITYing labels
some ain't had hits since i seen aunt mabel
be doing artists in like cain did abel
now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
that's what you get when you misuse what i invent
your empire falls and you lose every cent
for trying to blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
should've pumped it when i rocked it
niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors they're scared to death to pump these
first of all, who's your a&r
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
but he don't know the meaning of dope
when he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
and i'm the dirtiest thing in sight
matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight


yo, hah yo, rahh, yo, yo
yo, yo, yo...
yo, i got stress on my brain that causes chest pains
inside the best frames ghetto blood clots is scored by slug shots
and drug spots, well if you're too poor to move out
or get a new PROFANITYuse, it's like livin in a war walkin through shootouts
and you doubt PROFANITY exists, when hard fists
be poundin on your head like jackhammers
you're trapped in the black drama, you hear the laughter
seconds after that you fade out, you're played out, you're laid out
your heart nearly gave out, you're lucky that you made out
with just a few scars when the beating ends
but evil men, will soon be on the receiving end
of universal law, i'm callin on the meek and the poor
to fight back and never forfeit the day you have to go to war
with forces that are armed upon the seven continental borders
a mental fortress is essentials to absorb this
my sword hits the human orb until it orbits
in the art of war kids see grym reap be morbid
since pieces of the lost civilization in the past
had my photographs etched inside of pyramids
to laugh at this revelation, without 365 days of concentration
and twenty-four PROFANITYur meditation, would be foolishly pagan
i'm ancient as 'amen', see i stay grym
throwin fools in in a pit full of pit bulls to be shaken
or strapped to the crossroads of PROFANITY and inner sin
which trap the sinners in, to sell such in sing-sing
i bring grym tidings, tidal-ed/titled your wave all not exciting
stop riding the PROFANITY, start writin your own PROFANITY
cause i stick figures that think they fat and can't rap wind blast
i make em slim fast, lookin like stick figures
i'm all that, i bag chips at concerts and shows
get more PROFANITY than PROFANITYs that boost victoria secret clothes
foes is tagged like ex-foes toes at the coroner's
kids with cold feet rise and fall like the barometer
grym will mentally chop your career
see PROFANITY is locked down here, like penitentiary blocks in tears
escape outta your ducts every time you hear my name
you better duck fate, or catch a PROFANITY face full of duct tape
you get smacked like a trick that sniffed off her money
then smoked like rzarector with the blunts dipped in PROFANITYney

rotate your head like a gyro, my hair grows in knotty spirals
feet resembles christ's description from the bible
water-walker, immune to all physical torture
pull out fast in a porsche, upon a double-crosser
my PROFANITY rise up in the morning like a phoenix
and blast iron cells into a low blooded 'nemic
the imperial - material's venerial
mc's get PROFANITYed in serial, you can't PROFANITY with the material
unorthodox paradox, my PROFANITY is seen wide-screen magnavox
grabs thought like doctor octopus
cause war like the grandson of kush
i'm hangin devil's heads on a evergreen bush
sugar-frosted sorceresses PROFANITY get exhausted
pussy lips be drippin, like leaky faucets
undercover c-cyphers sprayed up like windshield wipers
while i'm guzzlin piper's, changin my son's PROFANITY-ass diapers
dime piece trapped in sync like many time piece
you get stampeded by the wildabeast
a rap dast' plus tracks black like chow yun fat
oppositional forces get their eardrums flat
common denominator, i swing the mic saber like vader
he was fooled by the inter-pre-atation made from a traitor
mc's get their wigs blown, trounced off my fistbone
choked from my death, every time they break a wishbone
eventually, i knew the whole world would mention me
potentially, i have the key to make g's
mc's breeze on my tracks, i rock the fruit with the trees
killa bees spread rapid like diseases
see it's, like the second comin of jesus, of nazareth
be fabulous, raise the dead crowd up like lazarus
hazardous vocabulary attacks be beautiful
acoustical notes we provoke, it comes out musically dope
niggaz realize they just can't cope
the hair, bustin out the head resembles fire and smoke loc

i blast watts in circuits like general monk-monk was turkish
my science is PROFANITYided deep into your central nervous
pervert area codes PROFANITYp this PROFANITY
i'm boxed-in, PROFANITYin PROFANITYlogram PROFANITY, inhalin oxygen
parallel world of crab PROFANITY and sea shells mix
i pierce my PROFANITY and sword right through you pelvics
i'm PROFANITY stricken bomb, wrapped in trees of palm
physical existence is descendants of allah
i travel at high rates, weaker men are primates
that either migrate or get burnt to the stake
i feed off lyrical light beams of amphetimene
my terminology is panatomic like lobotomy
crazy el loco, gas PROFANITY like sunoco
flush em like presto, blast in your chest bone
i raise from the shore, like PROFANITY and gomorrah
with traction, flashin a 4-wheel drive ford explorer
while mucus lies within the center of the rubik's
the roots of the wine induced the enzymes inside your nucleus
turmoil boilin appointed, PROFANITY rubbin off my style like a ointment
lost in the sahara, from trial and error
confused with 3 meals for sister sara
rahh! bearer, digestin minerals in abundance
because the dead is not known to return from the dungeons
run'din from fires of the city, and tee bloood
blooood, blood, bloooood.. blooood
you two ta both from ee-hee-ma, ah ya both from jahnker
you ta both from fire outside
you both from to-ah-ee
one bloood, one bloood, one bloood

i was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
rugged with my timberland boots that paid
i walk with a slight lean from the way that my heat
givin a green the shine infra-red beam
at the stret traffic light recorders
takin pictures of our corners
cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
the chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
we movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
with plastic phasers in rubber hands
fuck fame, i shoot a PROFANITYle in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
how dare you call the PROFANITYs in vein!
not knowin the seriousness of this and why i came
to earth, feet first
i dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
no questionin to the session, i walk with gun
the magnum of bust-es head for many directions unknown
another statistic, change the bolistics
on the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
scrape the craters of the brain for data
old scriptures on withered paper
beginnin take shape and form
when the PROFANITYs get on it and crash your college dorm

you two ta both from uptown, ah your both from downtown
your ta both from an-ah-town, ah yah both from 'roundtowm
one bloood, one blooood, one blooooood
the PROFANITY 'nit find it
travel w'on, raise your wine
that's blooood yuud, blooood

now verse 2, even more deadly than the first, unrehearsed raw footage
part 2 for you, i give this dedication, project elimination
he's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
i'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
here's jewels to live by
identify before you enter and can't leave with PROFANITY
fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
a PROFANITY only has one time to explode
when i break i'm takin everything, 
turn the city streets to dusty rhodes
behold this return of the invincible tone

stabbing devils in their chest with a rusty ship anchor
blood and sand we command and conquer
wasted land,
then expand the regions undiscovered by modern man
body counts increase by thousands by the PROFANITYur
the PROFANITY on reserve blastin PROFANITYts from the water tower
absorbin' energy from the sun mc's run
my brain burst like to blow chunks outta you lungs
blood on the pavement
crews gaze in amazement
i was doing that to PROFANITY who test me on the PROFANITY ship
we sell tapes and stage jail breaks for past cell mates
murder you at PROFANITY's gate daring PROFANITY to yell PROFANITY
and pale face gests PROFANITYllow points i swallow joints
with romantic charisma that'll make your momma moist
my voice ensemble of bullets rip through your squadron
circulate the planets move back you better dodge 'em
or get opened up like a margin
buddah sargeant,
christ i should've warned you i never missed a target
the living weapon war machine by buried king
relentless remorse is guiltless and unclean
also the sources supreme of my team
black knight brigade PROFANITYls caps like tangerine
holocaustic, hypnotic, PROFANITYtic, sub-atomic,
psychopathic, hyperactive, unattractive

we bring nothing but punishment
like nice be runnin' PROFANITY
have 'em runnin' quick
uppercuts is what we coming with
fuck the government
i grab the mic, that's when the thunder hit
never love a PROFANITY
rhymes echo throughout the dungeon pits

something from my culture
i stay to harmony
the way of life that best suits me
i sincerely love allah's mathematics
freedom and raw the abbott
i rest within the square
which is 4 times 90 why PROFANITY trues dare
the dominant intelligence
99 elements we're offspring celibate
without knowledge life's irrelevant
i wrote the benevolent (wu-tang eminent)

i bring lyrics to existence
when i speak these powerful words
the priest of pandimonium the wargod has emerged
above sea-level that's when thunder rolls
and lightning strike down
atrocity lay that poor PROFANITY and rain it for you compund
chaotically the black knights we move PROFANITYally
lyrically perform labotamy on your biology a PROFANITYigy
a philosophy and theology my idiology's to break down
mc's microscopically
the ghetto tropically gettin' more hectic by the second
ghetto warfare straight bullets hit off the window sectors
and hit kids cause PROFANITY spit wigs with no precautions
the war i raise down from their grave to haunt your concious
with PROFANITY screams nightmares and bloody dreams
of PROFANITY haunting you through dark alleyways
through missing smoke screen
have you tweaking like a PROFANITY fiend
on high bean like christine
the lords rain supreme


i'm original mallot
with metaphor dominant intelligence
i give a PROFANITY a PROFANITY detention with his
birthstar invention
i was mentioned i be creeping with the intention
to break free from this evil mad society
don't lie to me
i'm dope, i scope stuff i like to telescope
to provoke from being choked
cause my ability is soul lying
and let me open up your insides
and man hide,
not from confusion with this high energy i'm using
static got you lighting and moving
through the abyss where snakes hiss
and many men get PROFANITY for following false elements
for following false elements

yo, be for real
i was buried on a battlefield

i was buried on a battlefield
located near israel
the rest of my platoon
was trapped upon a hill
i heard mega...
...yo, be for real

i was buried on a battlefield
i heard megabombs, firearms, and more alarms
and hand grenades, mad rage in evil ways
my destination was to seek life
i mean the stars were so low they appeared as street lights
i was shown the crucifixion by two egyptians
there was war in heaven, i saw christ with a mac-11
so i joined his army, prepare for armaggedeon... armaggedeon...

they told me this, slowly
taking me, into, the mental
orgasms, 'jacualting, stimulating, relating
to life, incubating, rotating around light beams
from a light beam i was formed in the white dream
and then redeemed, like powder, out of, my maker
into, nature, returned, to vapor
killah, priest, was born, in a pillar, of yeast
lost in the miscarriage
the automatic, for marriage
the game of chess, is like a swordfight
you must think first, before you move
toad style is immensely strong, and immune to nearly any weapon
when it's properly used, it's almost invincible

raw i'm gonna give it to you, with no trivia
raw like PROFANITY straight from bolivia
my hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
like the emancipation proclamation
weak mc's approach with slang that's dead
you might as well run into the wall and bang your head
i'm pushin' force, my force your doubtin'
i'm makin' devils cower to the caucus mountains

well i'm a sire, i set the microphone on fire
rap styles vary, and carry like mariah
i come from the shaolin slum, and the isle i'm from
is coming through with nuff PROFANITY and nuff guns
so if you wanna come sweating, stressing, contesting
you'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
phony PROFANITY are outlined in chalk
a man vexed, is what the projects made me
rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
steamrolling PROFANITY like a eighteen wheeler
with the PROFANITY driver driving, there's no surviving

rough like timberland wear, yeah
me and the clan, and you're the landcruisers out there
peace to all the crooks, all the PROFANITY with bad looks
bald heads, braids, blow this PROFANITYok
we got chrome tecs, nickel plated macs
black axe, drug dealing styles in phat stacks

so grab your eight plus one, start flipping and tripping
niggas is jetting i'm licking off son

(wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang!!!!)

homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
what justifies the PROFANITYmicide, when he dies?
in his own iniquity it's the
master of the mantis rapture coming at you
we have an apb on an mc PROFANITYer
looks like the work of a master
evidence indicates that's it's stature
merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
the flow, changes like a chameleon
plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
this technique attacks the immune system
disguised like a lie paralyzing the victim
you scream as it enters your bloodstream
erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
moving on a PROFANITY with the speed of a centipede
and injure - any PROFANITY contender

shaolin shadowboxing, and the wu-tang sword style
if what you say is true, the shaolin and the wu-tang
could be dangerous
do you think your wu-tang sword can defeat me?

nigga save that, the same PROFANITY you had it last year
you be runnin with them outsiders
that PROFANITY is PROFANITY up yo, we never turn to PROFANITY riders
your mac is big, got a little grip, yo
you think that PROFANITY gon live what he did -- what this PROFANITY said
remember when his mans got there, the whole PROFANITY was set up
shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
it got back to me some PROFANITY in medina askin me
"you know some PROFANITY in the gold e-class," splash to me
yo that PROFANITY you had in vegas
yo, it coulda got us both sprayed up, they seen the ac, know this traitor
hair sa-laundry and shorty like karan
her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
octavia with all the ice on, yo
she own a carwash now, her little keon doin triple life
marry a son who got baked, it coulda been
for a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her
shit is PROFANITY up when they got us yo
she fainted at her baby wake now watch the breakdown
"..face responsiblity"
she fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto street"


yo all of y'all PROFANITY got the whole story wrong
talk what you talk but twist the real song
when it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
show y'all PROFANITY whose style is more liver
this is not a act this is more actual fact
nuttin but experience placed upon track
with the true sound, not lyin out the crown
when we not workin we hardly be around
yeah see the light, right now we could fight
you not a real brother you just a fake type
that get on the mic then, throw your cliche
half the east coast soundin just like rae
if you a gambino, give credit to the flow
if you not a part of this kid act like you know
fuck the studio, cappachino the great
fly cherry head PROFANITY like planes out of state
i ain't friends with you, only my cd hit you
if you want some then stop frontin is the issue
it's my turn, live PROFANITY could pass
two-face-ted rappers push they PROFANITY last
straight off the edge, into the PROFANITY
peep my new style PROFANITY cristal and moet
i drink evian water while my thoughts get published

"what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
what you gonna do when you grow up..."

"what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"


one is invulnerable, in fact
it involves strenuous breath control
out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
the human PROFANITYy has a PROFANITYdred and eight pressure points
thirty-six of these can be fatal
the remainder, paralyzing
what y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
i'm the osiris of this PROFANITY
wu-tang is here forever PROFANITY
this like this ninety-seven
aight my PROFANITY and my PROFANITYrettes
let's do it like this
i'mma rub your PROFANITY in the moonshine
let's take it back to seventy-nine

i bomb atomically socrates' philosophies
and hypothesis can't define PROFANITYw i be dropping these
mockeries lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me
battle-scarred shogun explosion when my pen hits
tremendous ultra-violet shine blind forensics
i inspect you through the future see millennium
killa beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets queen beez ease the guns in
rumble with patrolmen tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor die-hard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow swinging swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked performing live on your PROFANITYttest block

as the world turns i spread like germ
bless the globe with the pestilence the hard-headed never learn
this my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
transform into the ghost rider a six-pack
and a streetcar named desire who got my back?
in the line of fire PROFANITYlding back what?
my peoples if you with me where the PROFANITY at?
niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
it's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad PROFANITY
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm what the blood
clot we smoke PROFANITY and blow spots
you wanna think twice i think not
the iron lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
guns of navarone tearing up your battle zone
rip through your slums

i twist darts from the heart tried and true
loop my voice on the lp martini on the slang rocks
certified chatterbox vocabulary 'donna talking
tell your story walking
take cover kid what? run for your brother kid
run for your team and your six camp rhyme groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
my deadly notes reign supreme
your fort is basic compared to mine
domino effect arts and crafts
paragraphs contain cyanide
take a free ride on my dart i got the fashion
catalogues for all y'all to all praise to the PROFANITY

the saga continues
wu-tang wu-tang

olympic torch flaming we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory the agony defeat
we crush slow flaming deluxe slow
for judgment day cometh conquer it's war
allow us to escape PROFANITY globe spinning bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tunes spit the PROFANITY mortal kombat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle PROFANITY vigilante tantrum
a death kiss catwalk squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom tranquilized with anesthetics
my orchestra graceful music ballerinas
my music sicily rich california smell
an axe PROFANITY adventure paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing-sing sipping on ginseng
righteous wax chaperon rotating ring kings

maech or the wooden soldiers c-cypher-punks couldn't PROFANITYld us
a thousand men rushing in not one PROFANITY was sober
perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like flair
escape from your dragon's lair in particular
my beats travel like a vortex through your spine
to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw PROFANITY
enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
heart terminal like grand central station
program fat basslines on novation
getting PROFANITY like a PROFANITY i'm ducking five-year probation

war of the masses the outcome disastrous
many of the victim families save their ashes
a million names on walls engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for their acts
another heart is torn as close ones mourn
those who stray PROFANITY get slayed on the song

the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
ninety-three million miles away from came one
to represent the nation this is a gathering
of the masses that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle the crowd now screams in rage
the high chief jamel irief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save self from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

yo! yo! yo PROFANITY that look at all these crab PROFANITY laid back
lamping like them gray and black puma's on my man's rack
codeine was forced in your drink
you had a navy green salamander fiend
bitches overheard you scream
you two-faces PROFANITY of the slum i got your whole PROFANITYy numb
blowing like shalamar in eighty-one
sound convincing thousand dollar cork-pop convention
hands like sonny liston get fly permission
hold the PROFANITY up i'll unfasten your wig bad luck
i humiliate separate the english from the dutch
it's me black PROFANITYle drew ali
came in threes we like the genovese
sazon season these degrees
it's earth ninety-three million miles from the first
rough turbulence the wave burst split the megahertz

aiyo that's amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk
connect dots to make my man child walk
swift notarizer blue-tang all up in the high-riser
new york yank' visor world tranquilizer
just a dosage delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean see y'all the number one draft pick
tear down the beat PROFANITY then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor flex the white-gold tarantula
track truck diesel play the PROFANITY PROFANITY substantiala
max mostly undivided then slide in sickening
guaranteed made 'em jump like rod strickland
countdown...
are you ready? are you mad inside?
got you strapped down to your seats
outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
god speed, approach follow my lead
firewinds gust, empire crush
full PROFANITY, fall in the PROFANITYle, roll wit the rush
untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
soundwaves slay out the back, ?cave? smoke
my belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
down PROFANITY, elegant as fantasia
killer whale tale inhale, black male from asia
all out the wood works, PROFANITYod shirts and wizards
no match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
in the shaft, shotty cop, hip PROFANITYp to the limit
nightwatch, pad mark
sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
gimmie what it takes now!!

rage rock roll fight
brawl fall PROFANITYblllllleee!!!

the diabolic witty, dialect's darker than gotham city
wit the possibilty to stop your walkin ability
god forgive me, spark enemies wit pistol grips
the missle tip's impact hit you so hard, you PROFANITY through your PROFANITY
official scripts strikes when physical hits
you physical PROFANITY, watch for the imperial blitz, serious PROFANITY
submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
liver than wwf warzone
walk upon ? tracks, PROFANITYies collapse
rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when PROFANITYtery PROFANITYs
logical facts from the terror dome
spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
in PROFANITY you now entrust
dog you like PROFANITYund and mutts, pound pups get sound struck
clown what? you'll get drowned in the cut
while crowd round up

verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
of a PROFANITYdred wild PROFANITY piled in a trojan PROFANITYrse

professional neck PROFANITY, left foes beheaded
this music, is mind control like computer chips
been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
wit turbo tactics, manuever like a trained soldier
hall of fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
ayatollah, high roller nine totter
mind controller, 2009 time folder

slowly i turn, face the one and only
naughty by nature, i do my dirt all by my lonely
ask pretty tony, when i got a PROFANITY i keeps a bitch
36 chambers, enter at your own risk
take that watch off and tuck your necklace

cos its real on the battlefield
shells hit the ground from the steel
bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
words combine when i rhyme to feed the blind
prepare my queen for battle and walk down

niggas in the witness office probably eating
and sprinting and beefing, when they heard the shots
called the precinct and seen barber nieces beasting
niggas shot shalar features and shocked her was a elisis, 
bent the spinal cordless creatures
i'm gagging and flagging a cab down
guess who in the benz wagon, dragging my sound down
macking it was dale breedy the greedy
caniving PROFANITY snake genie
cop with a bikini will PROFANITY charge and benini
i'm feeling wheezy and the drain from the cheeba
grieving ain't even looking decent
seeing police PROFANITY reaching

that splash against my PROFANITYllow bones
that rocks my...

fleeing the crime scene speeding
beefing leaving behind cream
not even PROFANITYping that i was leaking
won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
still jakes are creeping
don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend
keep the ruger PROFANITYling who's squealing
few knew the dealings
keep the steel concealed in
cause we got no time for feelings
eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
million dollar block villain plotting on a PROFANITYing
feel like, a superhero talking like a true deniro
they boost his ego path and broke down
reduced to zero
cops feel we poors PROFANITYping i'll reveal my source, source

that splash against my PROFANITYllow bones
that rocks my soul
oh oh, oh oh

outside the check cashing, flashing
dipped in fashion
five cherry-faced PROFANITY tried to cash in
they keep laughing, ghost you get ya face bashed in
who gave you these priveledges son? why you PROFANITYng?
and we..
feigning to take those move slow
i'm hearing PROFANITYw you broke rob's nose
and i heard you keep a banging hammer
golden brass diamonds embroideries
that was stolen that you haven't reported g
make very little noise, my PROFANITY hiccup
don't make this big stick up bigger
me and the boys i thought for a second then chose
rather than froze
had the jim star on my hand
yo what the PROFANITY yo! that's when i ripped timothy
snatch and dip john like imbaggable

shots rang off, bing, boggle-de-dum

that splash against my PROFANITYllow bones

wu, tang, wu, tang
it's the wu, creepin in the shadows
wu, tang, wu, tang

"oh baby, for heavens sake"
sir i, excalibur
"oh baby, for heavens sake"
"oh baby, for heavens sake"


yo, aiyyo my rap style swing like willie mays
my eyes purple haze, my solar razor burn through shades
my grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
i glide like, PROFANITYvercrafts on the everglades
boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
limited edition composition spark friction
non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
wu original, true colors step from the melanin
the most high, most try, to get close by
and overthrow i, but choke, with they PROFANITYpes up high
i circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the richter
flies sense to flock when they spot this live PROFANITY
the crowd PROFANITYr black your third eye before i lose ya
verbal high i leave stars in the eyes of medusa
top ten, parley like cochran, it's often
narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
murder rap, PROFANITY you soft like roberta flack
words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks

wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake" 


now all pay tribute to this entity
a spark that surges through the undergrowth
overwhelmin the populace from the entry
the wu-tang dynasty, has emerged
from this elite fleet
i was appointed to strike the vital nerve
mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
seeds of mc's at these fake PROFANITY industry PROFANITY
feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
and spray, an array of shots
that travel downwind, just respect pyrhiffic pen
as i send, the minds of the weak
to rise and take power i blew tower-ing over the land
as we stand, expanding our cream
a dollar to every grain of sand
let the mind use the physical as planned

"oh baby, for heavens sake"
wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake"


yo, yo, this is beirut
try to comprehend check out my new suit
gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
dissapear from here, my year, drop the PROFANITY lp's everywhere
fallin out the sky tall PROFANITY
raps by cappadonna hit the countryside
poetry whirlpool, rza and true collide
we PROFANITYuce article exception to the rule
we the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
cats that made that watergate thing go spoiled
the heavy-handed, locked down stranged with cyrus
wu pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
low down PROFANITY, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
slang reverand, put the best work in

wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake"
yo... this song is...
aiyyo dunn this song is called sunshower
cause we approachin the final PROFANITYur
you know i ahh all i can say to my brothers and sisters right now
is stay close to your families, and all your loved ones
cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
they PROFANITYin for pennies, knahmsayin?
peace to the PROFANITYs, we got a heavy job... yo, yo

trouble follows behind a wicked mind, 20/20 vision
of the prism of light but still blind
because you lack the inner, every sinner
will end up in the everlastin winter of PROFANITYfire
throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
you cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out
you remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external
along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
and permanently upon this journey
through the journal of the book of life
those who took a life without justice
will become just ice ice ice
it's been taught that your worst enemy can harm you
as much as your own wicked thoughts
what devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint
now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
iron PROFANITY with the strong blend of PROFANITY and blend of sandal
with rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans
burn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
i'm convinced, allah is PROFANITY always has been always will be
you could travel every square inch of the planet earth and still be
ninety-three million miles away from the sun
til you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge
know the ledge to where your heart is
or fall off into the internal PROFANITY that's uncharted
light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second
through time and PROFANITYe, until it reach a target
and once we're freed of darkness, and show em where the path
yo as the red sea was parted, into these straight
at the narrow gate, but why that's a road to destruction and hate
what you thought life was a sport? a game?
one PROFANITYdred years short, know the soul is immortal
walk through many portals, and those who go astray
will pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked PROFANITY
ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
with dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate
instead, i chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
of life and fed PROFANITY degree of light to my head
it's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so i stay awake
and take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin
so we can see each other, cause every color
that makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?
who's the original, who's the biochemical
who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital
digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

two PROFANITYdred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
while PROFANITY minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
the sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em
stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum
and shatter bone fragments
cops love the block you gettin backed up by dragnet
thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
flippin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block PROFANITYody's havin it
those who haven't learnt get returned
you freaky PROFANITY PROFANITY get burned
some walk around like they ain't concerned
with the PROFANITY goin on inside the world
why do grown men PROFANITY little girls?
is it because the girl's breast has swelled
to the size of a woman, although she's twelve
the whole world is sick, sick, sick
trapped up in six, six, six
i started off as a PROFANITY in this marathon of life
tryin to carry on, wishin i had a bomb to blow up babylon
a PROFANITYabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon
goin in circles, like a ferris wheel
undernourished meals i cherish PROFANITYpe, drown inside the sea of life
use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night
to far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
you couldn't see a spark of light
while others play ball, i recall, me and gza, PROFANITY
hangin in halls, bangin on walls
kickin rhymes three PROFANITYurs straight with no pause
boostin from freeport sunrise to amityville morgue
kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws
started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
to wearin long cables that PROFANITYg down to the navel
so pack some PROFANITY and fat sacks of skunk
to funnel the p-funk, smokin woolie blunts
dust PROFANITYtails and primos, shot more dice than casinos
back when wu-gambinos were called f.o.i. mc's
all and together now crew b.c.c.
rec posse, g.p., d.m.d.
ol PROFANITY stalked east new york gza maintained franklin lane
i was going to thomas the jeff, where students got slain
old earth got nervous walked me to shaolin sent me to curtis
took share time in marquis, u-god general contractin service
while PROFANITY chef and deck was off the nu-dol
for white boys who took steroids
buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
back when our girlfriends was PROFANITYs
cuttin class with ghost tryin to bag PROFANITYs in mary birchem
a maybeldine beacon night school washington irving
these young PROFANITYs was seekin
hoes in westinghouse and clara parton and medina
girls who sung like sarafina
on the corner of belmont and picket avenue i seen her
as if i dreamed her
i was dead broke, now i will use key notes to make g-notes
so it's always PROFANITYpe
see subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
to the heart of medina, but shaolin is the brain
so take heed to these words
and feel the power of the sunshower

i'm the PROFANITY that got you talkin bout "fight the power"..


yo check one two
without me havin my finger in the plug
i'm gettin shocked anyway, hahaha!

"since you're all so skilled,
let's fight your way - shaolin style.  come on!"
feel this,
to all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds for the
countless victims and all their families of
the PROFANITYed, tortured and PROFANITYd, PROFANITY, robbed and persecuted
never again, to the men, women, and children.
who died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.
reuven ben menachum, yo..

yo my own blood, dragged through the mud
perished in my heart still cherished and loved
stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
families cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide
tossed to the side, access denied
6 million died for what? yo a man shot dead in his back
helpless women and children under constant attack
for no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding
yo it's freezing, and men burn in PROFANITY, some for squeezing
no PROFANITYpe for a remedy, nothing to believe
moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your PROFANITYy
late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty
having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions
deceived by the devils decisions, forced into a PROFANITY
death before dishonour for those men who were brave
shot and sent to their grave, can't awaken, it's too late
everything's been taken, i'm shaken, family, history, the making

never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
never again shall we sit and take orders
stripped of our culture, robbed of our name
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
forced from our families, taken from our PROFANITYmes
moved from our PROFANITY then burned of our bones
never again, never again, shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
leave our sons and daughters, PROFANITYped of our culture
robbed of our name
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
forced from our families, taken from our PROFANITYmes
moved from our PROFANITY and everything we own

some fled through the PROFANITYors of wars
but most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
with just one loaf of bread, banished, PROFANITYld in for questioning
and vanished, never to be seen again, i can't express the pain
that was felt in the train to auschwitz, tears poured down like rain
naked face to face, with the master race, hatred blood and david
my heart belongs to PROFANITY and stay sacred
rabbi's and priests, disabled individuals
the poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
mass extermination, total annihilation
shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
tortured and starved, innocent experiments
stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
the last PROFANITYur, i smelled the flowers
flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
powerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest
crying, who would've guessed -- dying, another life lost
count the cost, another PROFANITYy gas burned and tossed in the PROFANITYlocaust


never again, never again
the final solution is now retribution
remedy, wu-tang..

fire!
(can it be that it was all so simple then)
knowhati'msayin, take you on this lyrical high real quick

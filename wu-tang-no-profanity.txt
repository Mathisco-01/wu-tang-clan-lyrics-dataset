i pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
i'm a chip off the board game, got sword game

darts on layaway, beats on standby
outfits pressed up, ready for airtime

a athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
wildest PROFANITY who sprint off the gun sound
the best time yet still 7.0
swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow
[rza]
tempted by the sins of life, the pleasures of PROFANITY
with wild imaginings that you can't discuss
oh, the flesh is weak, it's a struggle for feast
it's a daily conflict between man and beast
we, strive for PROFANITY, and a better tomorrow
still suffering, from the unforgettable sorrow
repent from thy sins, son, and walk these straight
stop talking all that trash, boy, and spark these straight
evicted by the pressures of life, at every vital point
still, i wouldn't give an oint'
or, flinch an inch, or pitch a pinch
off the pie, or every try to try your winch
confronted by the devil himself, and stay strong
you think you can take the king, now meet kong
strong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting
how many mc's, have sprung from our fountain
fifty thousand year process, to make this combination
i'm not, giving mine away to satan
although, i know that he's awaiting
to get ahold of my biochemical equation
i'mma slip him son, i'mma dip him, son
when i catch the drop on him, i'mma clip him, son
fifty thousand year process, to make this combination
ninety nine elements, biochemical manifestation
i'm not giving mines away to satan
although, i know that he's awaiting
i'mma slip him son, i'mma dip him, son
when i catch the drop on him, i'mma clip him, son

[mf doom]
bet oc', straight to the head with the pet rock
at least til i can get from out this booth, it's like a sweat box
trained a few bars of head nodding, throw us a stack
pants militant sawed up like linen, bobbing bonus pack
invest in the first b-boy kid show, life on skid row, with jive talking PROFANITY's
he wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly
and kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he?
is he in the backyard, or on your front porch
or standing in the corner of the club, with the blunt torched
you're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving
and sold odds and bob kins, to old PROFANITYs and goblins
valley, adjust a pest and your worst best friend
who mending with PROFANITYe time fabric like polyester blend
not a PROFANITYbby for no PROFANITYy, lead less from men
or sloppy like the rest of them, they probably need estrogen

[rza]
yo, yo, PROFANITY or sober, son, don't lose your composure
semi off the remy, mixed with henny, moet demi'
underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'
israeli issued, automatic black pistol
the cop with the flashlight, chew gum as he whistle
tapped on the glass, roll it down fast
license, registration, addressed to your lab
they made insurance, the reason why i pulled you over
cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober
have you been drinking? breathe into the breathalyzer
get out the car, please, follow this exerciser
put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe
walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road
my PROFANITYmeboy kano, used to do the mashed PROFANITYato
on cartwheels, and then spin PROFANITYuse like whirled tornado
that used to chase the light, but, son, he will always save ya
becoming pump blows, and make beats inside my basement
drunk or sober, never lose your composure
stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
if you can't understand, then come closer
we civilize the uncivilized cuz we supposed to
drunk or sober, never lose your composure
might give your hand, black man stand as a soldier
stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
if you can't understand, then come closer...

a rhyme is a struggle from conception
series of complex maps in all directions

four years ago a friend of mine
asked me to say some mc rhymes
so i said this rhyme i'm about to say
the rhyme was PROFANITY and it went this way

yo, we took a test to become an mc
all the withers in the crowd got amazed at me
god threw me inside his cadillac
the chaffuer drove off and we never came back

meth cut the record down to the bone
and now i rock solid chrome microphones
now we signing autographs, with cheers and laughs
champagne, caviar, and bubblebaths, but see...

that's the life that i lead, you PROFANITYa mc, we g-o-d
take that and move back, or catch a heartattack
because there's nothing in the world the PROFANITYs could ever lack

i chill at the party in my b-boy stance
walk, cap low, 45 in my pants
fly like a dove, that come from up above
my PROFANITY's iron lung but you can stay one love

it's just a one two three a three a two one
throw your blunts in the air for the PROFANITY iron lung
blow them right in your face with the bass
you messed up, come in first place, the real rap taste

first come, first serve basis
coolin out boo, take you to the def places
one of a kind for you people's delight
and to you PROFANITYer mc, you know it ain't right
bet you bite all your life, cheat on your wife
run in a gun fight with nuthin but a knife
bangin with your boy, slingin with the crew
and everybody know what you've been through
it's the one two three three two one
throw your blunts in the air for your dunn iron lung
smoke in your place with the highs and the bass
come in first place in the real rap race
go uptown, buy a bag of brown
you PROFANITYer mc, a sad face clown
gettin od ready to rock crowds steady
you drive a big car get your gas from getti

[odb]
i'm odb in the place to be
didn't go to st. john's university

[sample:] "when you realize that what you got ain't what you want"

[gza:]
on the, yo, on the expressway, suddenly, i un-hit the breaks
a mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
i pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
the vibe got colder when the marksman said
"yo, you in the truck, get the PROFANITY out your car
put your hands where my eyes could see, not far"
a fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
plus my half pound just rang the bell
of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
i guess he was tired of the PROFANITY and booking PROFANITY
moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
some mc's wanted for a string of break-ins
last seen wearing lonk minks and snakeskins
[intro:]
okay PROFANITY it's like this
if we don't manifest our power to the fullest
man, you know what i'm saying?
nothing will become of everything that we plan

understand and understood PROFANITY
see we goin' show them the strength in what we doing
cause this is for he babies (indeed)
that's why it's on the strength
everything is on the strength

[verse 1:]
simultaneous anger to this life i'm no stranger
galaxy mission to attack in the track black
diplomats in the world called rapture
death was a concept i didn't want to capture
the laughter singing over? mantress d?
street colleagues slow up,
their man got tow up
guts be throw up sipping on PROFANITY
we sing from the creed of a begger's last son
cash fast fun, no life undone
take what you need son cause you daddy made mo' than one
and it was fun 'till reality formed screaming
from a palace where the weather's warm
yo you have to be the father and the lord of the score
used to PROFANITYver here now it's cutting your vocal cord
no mo' speaking the lies to the weak
'cause i'm about PROFANITYing these guys with my feet
today it's a stage maybe later it's a cosmic course
the general i be rocking on the PROFANITYrse
on the strength of course don't let it be in vain
cause it's time for the beggaz to reign, remain

[verse 2:]
a vision my facility a death world trilogy (you see that PROFANITY)
now fictional plots speak out through gunshots
battles won and lost at the of heaven's throne
the sky rains blood drowning the earth with red mud
i be sitting on the edge of mars counting stars
finding me a place in PROFANITYe unchaseable
no mortal can't fulfill such skill they incapable
of keeping all the planets in-line with one mind
make the sun and moon both shine at one time
i orchestrate the guns that air for PROFANITY's sake
precipitate make rain, hail, snow and earthquake
levitate the gravitational pull of haleys comet
shake the chords of earth make a euro-volacanic PROFANITY
ebonic with sonic waves that blaze the human flesh
it flames extra-terrestrial it's time to reap professional
feel the untestable force burning your course
hints of visible thoughts be the source of begga sorcery
... begga sorcery

[chorus:]
on the strength
time is money and PROFANITYn
on the strength
math is one and the same
on the strength
whining is something for pain
on the strength
beggaz for ever remain
[repeat]

[verse 3:]
buddah hava who lives the ways by nature
escape on a galactic PROFANITYe caper
to the nexus, transportation a glass lexus
forever present is wu chi in the essence
of life is immortal
we travel through portals that's phenomenon,
paragon through the octagon
my chi gong is calm, express through alvatron
love PROFANITY alright is the day destroys the night
knife PROFANITYides today feathers are harmonious
and universal ways to escapades
we take what we need to survive and stay alive
draw more sometimes as we break through the other side

[verse 4:]
the knoliton master law and order
astrolgoic civilize the human family throughout the populous
live forever like metabolics
everything i speak has logic
estimated all partsman of the chief king fistboxin'
inscribe within the begga doctrine
manual infold i roll protect my physic
from elements of the globe
we communicate like PROFANITYe probe,
remainder of the square frag the author
of the final chapter seven star grandmaster
pugilist john trappa m.d.
go-go thirteen professional mc
i bomb squads like hank sharpley
expose a fraud like hardcopy
i know click and shoot like paparazzi
with the never conclusive euro language of usage
street persona, my thought is blacker than the pre-madonna
far and beyond, if lickin' who warfare like sadam
invade everyone like ghangis khan
forever will remain
and the beggaz will continue go on...

we smoke tons of keef
fishing, looking for that big-mouth bass
and flashing, jack your whole stash
in fashion, keep my goons lined
in an orderly fashion
itâs glossy with 500 PROFANITYrsies in the benz
tinted out to spend the night
you ainât got angel funds is low, stack
your PROFANITY been PROFANITY-jacked
still scoop her up, bring her PROFANITYme
and blow that, cause ghost be mostly
looking pretty toasty
front row at mayweather vs. mosley
with a bin laden bottle
a brazillian model
got the paparazzi jumping
like they hit the lotto
party hard, like iâm fresh
out of the cages
i rages like charlie sheen out in vegas

[verse 2]
you drop your pants at your ankles
at the PROFANITY at a ballgame
iâm on the stool getting brain
from a tall dame, cause iâm 5â8â
shorty like 6â2â
feed her PROFANITY, locked jaw
like a pitbull. i was born to rep
you PROFANITY with a PROFANITYrnetâs nest
old shooters in the corner like PROFANITYrnacek
young boys that be handling the rock
chris paul dish off, hammer in the sock
gold flakes in the gold schlager
the ammo green xj12, you know the old jaguar
got the burch wood lacing the interior
poppy bagels getting flavored out in syria
only the fonz, best laced plates
cheese that reach maturity, PROFANITY PROFANITY from shannon doherty
take your temperature PROFANITYly and PROFANITY
make a batch of PROFANITYme drizzle royally with oil

[verse 3 - termanology]
hopping out the rolly royce
rolls gold nouveau
diamond-studded shoes, so
flyest PROFANITY you know
puerto rican version of scarface
fuck with the PROFANITYâs say
disrespect, PROFANITY in your broadâs face
chains stay chunky like oprahâs belly
got the purple and the brown:
peanut PROFANITYer and jelly
when i step up in the spot with the rock
youâll see the popular pop rappers
go in their pocket and pull out their wallet
when i click-clack, now get up on the ground
cause i onyx, pete rock, chuck d shut em down
you know term, iâm the kid with the âpreme beats
butter pecan j lo, kid with the mean cheeks
boobies on my gold fronts, iced out note book
making volcanos in the kitchen when the PROFANITY cook
i rode around with all kinds of PROFANITYs
high on drugs, PROFANITY out tiger blood
[intro skit]
someday i'm gonna be walkin down the streets,
mindin my own business.. and bam!!
i'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna swear
that it was a mistake.
i accept that as a part of my destiny!

(si es mi destino morir en la calle como un perro! hahaha)

[chorus]

[nas]
i scream at the mirror, curse, askin PROFANITY, "why me?"

police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
it takes more than metal bars, we destined for ours
i hear PROFANITY plans from dopefiends, with elephant hands
snots in they nostril, the blocks is PROFANITYstile

[inspectah deck]

yellin PROFANITY her man, makin PROFANITYings off her lap dance
plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
drugged out, got you PROFANITYtin for crumbs stuck to the razor
semi-autos roar in the building hall
symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
call it a new york state of mind, gotta take mine
in the daytime, the jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
so i live by the sword and obey PROFANITYod laws
make my team click like high heels on wood floors

[chorus]
yeah
yo

expedite lyrics under a PROFANITYly spirit
thoughts forced to hang-glide
even a bird can hear it
a bald head with gold metal wings
look like it belong in a day
the coming of christ
worshippin' the elohim
that's the way i wear shades like ceelo green
it's darker than don cheadle
we're mean like his deleted scene
the prognosis, PROFANITYine opus
artistic third eye open, it leave you stuck in a PROFANITYsis
or the haemo-tosis
spit venom like a african cobra in the jungle
knowin' my tongue is PROFANITY
i raise the wu flag when they scream for glory
the clouds open, a beam of light, you hear my story
custom-made scrolls, handwritten in coffee
and feather-tip pens one of the prophets brought me
and that explains why i spin on the axis
born original, so my mind fades to blackness

seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

pledge music, we came up from bringin' out club music
acoustic jungle rap gave us all this project music
blood in it, plug PROFANITY get you mugged in it
steel with steel, i'm finally out the drug business
kneel proper for me, helicopter base, sage in it
lessons from professors on stage winnin'
nine swords, 36 chambers
it's like a chess board, keep slidin'
opponents get flamed on it
trainin' poems, been the game of thrones
we been raised and grown
these young boys come through, spray your PROFANITYme
facts, they gave me the ax, now lay it on me
criminals have to eat, it's facts, shorty
you're PROFANITY right i go the square miles
we're from the stairs, thousands of pens could hear us from the rare sounds
yeah, the phoenix comin', ten arabian staten-adians
who PROFANITYoded up, known to get it bouncin'

seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road

seen a lot of things
i can't live without my faith
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"give it up! but - it's - just - no - use!"

[chorus: sample]
"give it up! oh lord.... give it all to you
i try, but - it's - just -  no - use!"

[r.a. the rugged man]
aiyo, give it up, rush you up, no fuss, blood rush
cuss much, what's mine? you bust nuts, crunch crunch
spark the bud, what's what, the white king tut
out in so-fuck, look who they dug up, yup, it's the rugged
on the record with j-live, i could hardly believe this
i never thought i'd be rapping on no record with school teachers
hair flinch from the eighties, library, lies bury
tv, tell lies visually, kid you wit me, PROFANITYstility
humility, hillbilly, gorilla, he mentally illy
still is he, actually, really PROFANITYed me, billy
all that stuff you heard about me, is probably true
heard i got the aids virus, i probably do
ammunition spitting is him, is it, you listening
littering written, it's in slippers, get the rebel in him
sticking it with sinners, sizzlin' rhythm, verbally hit him
did he did it, or did he didn't, admit it
pretend he ain't offended, the men and women
every minute they in it, don't be
every illiterate ignorant critical dissed it
every idiot that ain't live it, they talking PROFANITY
i'm r.a. the rugged man, get off, my PROFANITY

[chorus]

[j-live]
give it up, for the PROFANITYs & the earths, ladies and gentleman
all the human families, the wicked can't stand me
the righteous man hands me the mic, it's uncanny PROFANITYw
one man's penalty's, is another man's boo-whore
the label pun's ironic, courtesy of this sport
still can't stop a grown man, from pressing report
a free man can either be freedom or free label
when you spent, what you make, to keep making, you can't save
a PROFANITY thing, no savings, that's PROFANITYw life'll enslave ya
that's why i strive daily; to be my own savior
i know when shine glows and reflects in my behavior
so caught in between checks, i spilled it in respect
so give it up, if your mission's belittling my position
as a microphone physician, making you listen
me and rugged man relate, through a previous poem
like he said, i'm mad famous, for being unknown
on records for ten years, i can hardly believe it
never thought i'd be perceived, as just some rapping school teacher
just some dude, that can cut and rhyme, same time
just some conscious kid, that's try'nna save the world through rhyme
just another underground, hand-to-mouth microphonist
stop your mirror rap, just to stop you in your tracks
this will stomp you on your track, justice is not just
another ordinary rapper, i'm the crown royal block
with a velvet bag, matter of fact, and since the swagger is back
and backed by, a whole nation of millions
you can't PROFANITYld me, my new floor is my old ceiling
that's why i'm guaranteed, to leave you with something you lack, so just

[chorus]
[intro: raekwon (samples)]
(make me yours) he get out of line, break his PROFANITY arm...
you know PROFANITYw it go (what am i supposed to say? yeeaaah)
you know, word up, not playing the games, with these PROFANITY, man
(somebody tell me what do i do...)
none at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man

[raekwon]
aiyo, jump out the acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
us locking the game, word to every hand on the lockmen
street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
this is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
study like lessons, PROFANITY in the game biting the grain
you knowing where it came from, stop it
you thought we wasn't coming? you dumbing, you blunted again
watch lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
can't nothing move when i rhyme, when i drop lines it's law out in egypt
love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
the only PROFANITY that'll glow'll be us
yo, throw me in sin city, leave me with the vultures and bats
then give me two weeks to bubble like kim PROFANITY
dirt dog, we miss you, now it's time to PROFANITY the game
cuz if things change, you know it ain't against wu

[chorus 1.5x: sample]
what am i supposed to say? yeeaaah
somebody tell me what do i do...

[gza]
we keep it PROFANITYt, keep the heat on the block
we never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
raining with the patchwork of puzzles
that was written in the year of the dragon
more raw than you could ever imagine
how much of a great blessing to a rap city
where the youth is PROFANITYically fed, from the witty
unpredictable, talent and natural game is lyrical
analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
a cuban link chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
ragu PROFANITY whose tomatoes are sundried
he gave y'all PROFANITY whiplash from bling bling
but my rhyme'll give ya PROFANITYt flash and moodswings
math shed light on PROFANITYine secrets, then science leaked it
for the lower level creatures that can't PROFANITYp it
i observe mc's, regardless
from a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...

[chorus]

[masta PROFANITYa]
let the track wind and ya mind flow free
remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
infinity, back to the source of which it came
energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
on and on and on and, travel with me
not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
for those who can't adapt, i lived it, PROFANITY it back
we have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when i'll squeeze
the brain feels something pop, hip PROFANITYp, locked in texts
fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
enough kicks, fitted crown, PROFANITYoned down
underneath the white t lies the four pound
this is forty-five minutes of menacing
dismantling, any mc opponent stepping in the zone
get ya face blown (get ya face blown)

[chorus]

[inspectah deck]
observe the word, when i speak, get the truth's heard
true to the curb, wu classic is the new birth
spreading the blessing across seven continents
arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
check the techniques, first bow to the abbott
witty unpredictable, gritty individual
valid, if it's actual, talent and it's natural
game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
i and i ride or die under the name
w-u, the primary, ya secondary
definitely not necessary, the legendary
you printed the blueprints to do this PROFANITY
moving the youth in the bricks
spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
through the chest, when i manifest my sick art

[method man]
speaking my mind, fall in line when i spit mine
still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
if this is a crime, find me guilty, i'm so sublime
so rapid with rhymes, same slacking is PROFANITYonine
revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the wu
gorilla the booth, PROFANITYy armored, them PROFANITYa proof
in living proof, i'm the wittiest unpredictable
most talented rap PROFANITYfucker you ever listened to

[cappadonna]
i'm a hustler, i grind til my pack is done
give a seed, mad knowledge til they PROFANITYed and run
can't PROFANITYody PROFANITY with me, i'm just too nice
smack PROFANITY in they head everytime i write
yo, i'm straight from park hill where the guns is popping
where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
go to school PROFANITY up, it's africa island
we poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent
[swnkah:]
a mi name swnkah, comin' live
kingston fight, black roots, youths from [?]
big up rza, mathematics, all wu-tang clan
a we come for chinatown to babylon

[rza:]
if i put my fist through the face of a racist
smack 'em tasteless
would i face three cases in court, locked in places
or shackled to a seat of a bus, a PROFANITYdred of us
life in america shouldn't be so tough
we got western civilization got me fighting for my civil rights
after fighting scores of war, we still fight for our civil rights
to be equal citizens with equal opportunity
equal chance to advance and uplift our communities
but instead we getting shot in the head
like a black man life ain't worth a loaf of bread
"stop or i shoot," you stop, they still shoot
buck, buck, buck they stomp you out with steel boots

[swnkah:]
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

[rza:]
they trying to distract us from our practice
and shackle us up, mentally retract us backwards
attack us like the prophet on the way to damascus
it's like we huddle up, had control of the ball, let 'em sack us
now they overtax us as if they want to collapse us
don't be diluted by this foolishness
30 years old man still want nothing do with this
try to find career and a beer on the weekend
and a freak he could take to the crib on the weekend
suv, xm, heat, only plays the weeknd
only wanna PROFANITY 5 am with no tweeting
honey's 25 should be working but she's twerking
nobodies tripping she could make money from PROFANITYping
and i'm sitting in the back sipping my 'yac
can't help but thinking that "what does her father think of that?"
probably because i got a daughter
i heard money mayweather, he makes it rain without water
he dropped 50 g's at a PROFANITY near the border
a dozen women crawling on all fours up
woah, hey, you should've saw her
you should've took that money to a college campus
but then again, i guess momma needed some pampers
but from my view, these wizards need some pampering
not [?] stop looting and tamperin' with the essence
even with a lack of substance
and she wonders why, why, why she can't keep her husband?

[swnkah:]
we come to unite people
every color, every race
every shape, every face
all around the nation
no discrimination
peace and love [?]
from generation to generation
jah, [?] not take it no more
[?] rza, wu-tang clan, take it to there
(oh, why, why?)

it's getting realer
streets gettin' PROFANITYtter, i could feel it
who am i to put a gun to another
i'm just trying to show love to my brother
hands up, i just pray to PROFANITY i make it out
(stop PROFANITYin' [?])
is my life not enough, am i hard to love
if it's america we trusted each other knock me down
and i'm just trying to live it up
only one life to live and i ain't trying to give it up

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why?

[beretta 9 (rza):]
ayo, this i dedicate to PROFANITY who bust guns
all my live PROFANITY who sold vamps and didn't "run"
my juveniles wild to stay out past their curfew
a build upon life and drink beers like their pops do
a subject of the streets, yo kid it's "burning season"
don't expose the joint without intentional reason
summer time (digital), dehydrated, PROFANITY out to quench thirst
quench thirst, we might want to stay in PROFANITYme, oh PROFANITY it
rock the camo', i got the ammo
a long shot, look like i play for the knicks
so call me rambo, beretta 9, PROFANITYarm' recon' (digital)
rob me, i might rob you, then it be on

[rza:]
digital...
radical "white boy" push skate board, not mountain dew
old splash, d'ya see that bright yellow shirt with the wu w?
faced you with the flight of a PROFANITYer fly wing
fierce as the eagle, sting of the underground beatle
might wobble or fall down inside the squabble
in summer time, PROFANITYed the ice cold bottle
take the swallow, and give all praises due to the true
and do the dew, just do the dew, do the dew...
[intro/chorus: madame d]
light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
his partner was shady.. tryin to PROFANITY the babies

[ghostface PROFANITYah]
aiyyo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in brooklyn
all this while he let the fiends cook it
the baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
dropped it off in the pj's and they bigged it up
then one day, PROFANITY jumped off real crazy
the middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
no clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
the PROFANITYer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
even though her leg was bitten
crackheads point the finger at detective slick morris PROFANITYtins
paleface cop who done popped the desk
and got the chop on his neck from when he knocked celeste
it was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
some PROFANITY know him as the PROFANITYson of gotti
and his black partner, he was scared to speak
he saw PROFANITYw they planted weapons on these kids in the street
he saw like over fifty PROFANITYies in like fifty-two weeks
he saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
they call him desk duty, robocop
younger dudes call him freddy krugs from the way he walk on the block

[chorus]

[raekwon the chef]
heard the disturbance out the window, oh PROFANITY they got my son
pulled over his tempo, brenda dropped the endo
had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
they always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
his partner turned red in his waist, mase done smacked her
with the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
he bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
the fifth relaxed her like a big PROFANITY pistol whipped her
heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her
she broke the PROFANITY, went and rushed the kid
wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
he grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it PROFANITYed
more cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
wildest PROFANITY just smilin cause it look live
they gave her forty years in new orleans, callin me (?)
shorty was young, by three days had a great bid

[chorus]

[gza]
you're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
you squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
all slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
you sometime me, don't need to remind me about
livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
the PROFANITY PROFANITYldin the door, the mugging no one saw
we played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
and the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
small percentage determined to strengthen they position
transformation from critical to, stable condition
but it still be obstacles on PROFANITY that's optical
watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
the money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
with they pockets and fridge PROFANITY, many aim to take it
whether - PROFANITYld up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
and for some, another way out, is music and sports
that's why i, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
that won the championship, with just oh on the clock

[chorus - repeat 2x]
[chorus: george clinton]
the fox, is kinda foxy, mr. wolf he's the guy
who chased red through the woods and ate grandma
but a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
unlike the wolf, who made a widower of grandpa

[u-god]

shark skin armor, i'll bring the drama

[chorus]

[masta PROFANITYa]
yo, would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it
or would you take it for somethin else and get to' the PROFANITY up
men come together for the common cause
to beat yo' PROFANITY, just because
there's a line you don't cross offendin the boss
while of course his one selectin through your head shot
i'm back in the yard again, the bars callin
15 sets of this will have you swollen
ladies like, "damn papa you lookin right
i'd love to give you some of this PROFANITY and i'm a PROFANITY"
i write when the energy's right to spark friction
dj cuttin it, spinnin it back mixin

i grew up on the crime side, the new york times side
stayin' alive was no jive
had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'lo goose
only way i be gettin' the g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this, son
rollin' with this one and that one
pullin' out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smokin' woolas at 16
and runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
makin' my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for PROFANITYs and PROFANITY
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
stickin' up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better, same PROFANITY 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
catchin' keys from 'cross seas
rollin' in mpv's, every week we made forty g's
yo, PROFANITY, respect mine, or here go the tec-9
ch-chick-pow! move from the gate now!

[inspectah deck:]
it's been twenty-two long hard years, i'm still strugglin'
survival got me buggin', but i'm alive on arrival
i PROFANITYp at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause PROFANITY is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed; i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
tryin' to get a clutch at what i could not
the court played me short, now i face incarceration
pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turned i learned life is PROFANITY
livin' in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes givin' chase
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed, and i ask: what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and PROFANITY rocks
and stray shots, all on the block that stays PROFANITYt
leave it up to me while i be livin' proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
and ain't tryin' to hear what i'm kickin' in his ear
neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
that what? that life is hectic

[method man:]
cash rules everything around me

takeover the mothership, brothers get to claim the covenant
universal lovin it, olive oil you rubbin it
check the thermometer, ever kilometer
rise by heat pressure, your thermostat couldn't measure
royal familia, atoms bombs from asquilia
dark ages, so read the page, mike and alenki
born on the cross between love and PROFANITY
genisis thru exeuse, larzurus, slash black barnibus
the PROFANITYly temple be the mental, you and see islamic
can you understand the clear picture

[chorus]
braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar
royal fam legacy, watch us travel far
positive energy, always corrects errors, royal fam rule PROFANITY
now and forever, what

[timbo king]
orotorical, PROFANITY is metaphorical
my editorial breaks down your monuments historical
geologist studyin land, usin the earth's crust
measurements, eight elements, atomic weight plus density
hi-techs, science, PROFANITYal gravity
revolve around my oro, i'm the soul that keeps spinnin, what
supernova, black quasar, my mental radar picks up
frequencies beyond the earth's equator
forver glow, electro, magnetic force field
thoughts build, we bomb for real, royal fam still exists
golden fist, your caught up in the devil's mist
fire war, royal sire laws, reveal this
protons, electrons, atoms cause explosions
my center of atraction, i'm the nucleus, you're frozen
my square be complete, architectual, visual
the sound spectrum strikes the mental then the physical
my perimeter PROFANITYs your diameter
bar codes are scanned from america to canada
what, from america to canada

get your mind ready

i knew this chick by the name of vevorine
who introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game
we did in the rain, on the PROFANITYod of a range
but vevorine, had a special friend called PROFANITY
she told me, that's PROFANITYw she met ray charles and marvin PROFANITYe
but back then, i ain't gon' front, i was peddling 'caine
in the, form of PROFANITY, she said that was a no-no
cause it's a poor man's girl, and i will never give love
to PROFANITYw fast PROFANITYe, that's low as PROFANITY was
martin had a dream, PROFANITY, i did too
to make it out the PROFANITYod, rich, PROFANITY, off that stoup
so, i took it that thaw, and hit the street
with bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
momma said, never get high on your own supply
especially if you plan to leave this PROFANITYod PROFANITY rich
reminiscing on my past, PROFANITY it brings me to tears
see the more money that comes in, the more i disappear
fresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear
new year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear
watch this PROFANITY, make me back it up, d'angelo knows the feeling
off that needles warm embrace, in a PROFANITY heeling
this tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
i'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past
baby, you gotta trust me, cause i gotta girl and you got a man
i don't want you to judge me, i just wanna be your friend
baby, you gotta trust me...

[khalid]
aiyo i live by the rules, trust nothing in skirts
cause with that big PROFANITY and a smile, she be waiting to flirt
with a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt
another PROFANITY in the jaw, more dick in the george
while you PROFANITYme sleeping, she creeping, you thinking it's yours
that's just PROFANITYw women is, i reminisce
on when i had to learn from experience, why they call you a PROFANITY
and i ain't the best, but i ain't never denied
tell me what PROFANITY, flow sicker, spit PROFANITY better than mine
the plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time
you get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine
i'm on the grind, i don't settle for mines, PROFANITY
with this track, a broad, with a pack, before i peddle a dime
line for line, whose the best artist, the rest y'all garbage
but it's awkward, it's PROFANITY backwards, they still spinning your garbage
it's me, blunt: the artist, y'all PROFANITY is garbage

[planet asia]
sweat jackets valor, rap money, looking like PROFANITY money
relax, money, PROFANITY, it's raw, sweet aromatic
backwood, fanatic PROFANITY, this is cali
vigilante's tattered, the wife beaters and khakis
i'm taking over, cause y'all, cooking too much baking soda
b12, rock selling PROFANITY vacation's over
medallion's guaca', only rock a three piece suit
whenever PROFANITYlding case, the cops try to stop us
my henchmen behind me, in black benz's with big toppers
get up on my life, PROFANITY, the kid's proper
wrist glint, the big PROFANITY, cult following fans be PROFANITY
this is grown man business, pay attention
or lay your position, PROFANITY around and have a fatal collision
the moment where you should of made your decision
i made it, i'm living, i'm paid and i'm winning
from the aid of my wisdom, i created a system
i despise your PROFANITYing, and PROFANITY
you're... despicable

are you, my judge?

it's just... you should be punished
i'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

[verse one: u-god]

yo, yeah, yo, yo
yo, yeah
check these high hats sting things moving through the PROFANITY
party robust, rec room style for you brothers
time's ticking, eruptments conduct
entering one funk before the drum dry up
dial, style, jab vocab slow
alphabet run, construction voice might blow
tap dance swelling hemingway novel model
for a breather, PROFANITY PROFANITY hide your bottle
cut down, come with something that's round and profound
blood brothers people of colors we get down
watch this fly, force feed things being said
nine diagram acid black evil red left his
mic half a dangle, seriouser man
my mic clapper def wish, everlasting plan
heavenly PROFANITY PROFANITYy, know me as the cleaner
night champion, old villain style seem a
kiss of spider, to PROFANITY saga why bother
godfather talk drama, fly swatters

number two, chao san poi

[verse two: the genius/gza]

this wu PROFANITY be hard to PROFANITY and full blown
rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
pro tools editing tracks that's rough
cause a jam without a live mc isn't enough
so we attack this, and grab all within reach
throw a scrap back to PROFANITY - perfect your own speech
shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
used by backup singers in atlantic city bands
niggaz look on, and get PROFANITYoked on this mic line
real thin and shift through the pipeline
lp's delivered with style and PROFANITYential
niggaz flowin smoothly in a sequential
order, revealin hidden tape recorders
stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura

[verse three: raekwon the chef]

twist the dac up, them PROFANITY with math is back up
watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
playground maneuver, jet to vancouver like this
two kahluas one chick she's german luger
get the PROFANITY on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
with the seal on dunn, deal on this, with the real on
next, rocky, ring, call it to decatur
slang soufleer PROFANITYme decorater, player
mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
somethin flashy, PROFANITY dead-armed is nasty
peep the ornaments enough to make shorty-wop stare at me yo
he PROFANITYed the PROFANITY might as well throw a chair at me

[verse four: prince rakeem/rza]

yo mc's wonder what's hip-hop thunder
tell you the truth it's just one nation under a groove
gettin down for the funk of it
like fred sanford in the biz...
yo one held his paraphenalia, a wu memorabilia
mailed by the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
bout the group recruit we scoop up cream like breyer's
then spread across the globe like telephone wires
thirty-six PROFANITYorted, shaolin imported
chambers been recorded, you're PROFANITY with the loops
time for royalty audit
fabulous establishment metabolism, blackfoot indian
cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
then grew to a physical PROFANITYy with five meridians
as the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
i got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
and politic with leo and russell
when PROFANITY is still rushin we'll brush you

he's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives

[verse five: masta PROFANITYa]

thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
ignite, blowin the mic to arabian heights
as i recite this medley, PROFANITY couldn't PROFANITY with the
deadly ground i PROFANITYld down
classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
panic and confusion echoes through the building
continuing to build, i strive for perfection
driven by the will to live, glocks i PROFANITYld
shots i give, while searchers of rescue teams
look for means of survival and who's liable
for this harrowing experience
you scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
and proceeds of the wu-tang academy
to PROFANITY up your anatomy with PROFANITYault and battery

number two, chao san poi
number two, chao san poi
he's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives

number one, yen chang wa
he's an adulterer, don't trust him
number two, chao san poi
number two, chao san poi
he's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives

i despise your PROFANITYing, and PROFANITY
you're... despicable

are you, my judge?

it's just... you should be punished
i'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
i despise your PROFANITYing, and PROFANITY
you're... despicable

are you, my judge?

it's just... you should be punished
i'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
king tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
of heron, don baron, sniff a bag of blow
fifth out, runnin' up in saks with the ill army
shake feds, play dead, yo check out what rae said
lay on ya hands, let the branson break bread
high energy, all my PROFANITY a kin to me
regardless PROFANITYw it go down i still get ten a ki
beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
nikes with the low goose on and i've been a beast
wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
good PROFANITY out, if i die fill up my headstones
with water, dough, acid and gold classics
all my PROFANITY who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab PROFANITY
max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets (caskets)
broke bugged PROFANITYs in the hallway PROFANITYng (maxing)

[interlude: inspectah deck (movie sample)]
still them 1-6-ooh PROFANITY, straight up (whoa, PROFANITYld up, hold up)

[inspectah deck]
the nozzel aim, rip through ya frame for pocket change
fiend for the rush PROFANITYur 4, then pop a vein
thousand dollar corks pop, pause or get off top
used to be a general, just lost your spot
animal PROFANITYuse, two grand'll handle ya mouth
beast mode with the g-code, cancel 'em out
son, i've seen PROFANITY, fell into the palms of satan arms
don that i am made 'em bow in the face of PROFANITY
graveyard shifting, different day, the same thing
the name ring then the chain swing and dames cling
money green, maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
(it was all a dream) advocated by the few who do live it
bloomberg, make a PROFANITY cop the mausberg
shorty ain't a shorty, he a shooter like wahlberg
old man told me, don't be, blind to deception, only
sharp with perfection, PROFANITY, ya mind is a weapon

[interlude: movie sample]
relax, you got ya muscles tight, relax
word... word...

[chorus: PROFANITYod man (u-god)]
first we told y'all PROFANITY, then we showed y'all PROFANITYz, huh?
(we gon' take it back with this)
by the time you get a show, we've been all around the globe, huh?
(we gon' take it back with this)
before you even had a name, you was screaming "wu-tang"
(we gon' take it back with this)
when we was running on the block, you was under ya pops, remember
(we gon' take it back with this... let's go)

[ghostface PROFANITYah]
armored truck money, shazam bangles, play the throne like
julius caesar, gorilla mob, slash, PROFANITYah's gaurd
fake passports and visas, all of my goons
they be carrying spoons, because boom, he had a massive seizure
hot chocolate lovers, guns is published
detroit PROFANITY out of town be dying to PROFANITY us
this is real talk, shank lullabyes
ben franks, we like jet blue we stay PROFANITYa high
curl on the dumbell l, we can't even s-p-e-l-l mtv or trl's
supreme novelists, we rank superior, guarding the post
down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area
ain't tryin' to hurry up
we like rebel PROFANITY powdered up wilding in the streets of liberia
no matter the crime, i'm beating the case
if i'm a wrong, a chair hit a judge right in his face
shitting shanks out, come to court dates
mittens on shines with blood wally's that's the color of wine

[u-god]
talk to me, my criminal mystique
kick back the boards, six thousand a week
pay PROFANITYmage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
i see ya sweat roll down ya cheek
and ya soft and sweet, ya talk is pork
get PROFANITYed in new york when i enforce the heat
and the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless
the way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
s.k., no stungun, smooth devices
time crisis, i played the game, low lifers
in a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in riker's
vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
shiesters with hate in their blood might bite ya
fuck that PROFANITY, ya wife don't write ya
cancel her, buy another one just like her
pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
the baby automatic PROFANITY like air force strikers
i'm still asiatic when i spill the hypeness

[interlude: movie sample]
the dark, and this place will come here
that's right!

[chorus]
"it has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose..somewhere in outer PROFANITYe."

"the mysteries of creation are there."

"up in the sky?" "up in the sky."

[john f. kennedy] "the moon and the planets are there.
and new PROFANITYpes for knowledge and peace are there.
and therefore as we set sail; we ask PROFANITY's blessing -
on the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure
of which man has ever embarked."

"prepared for liftoff."

[guru]
i self lord and master, shall bring disaster to evil factors
demonic chapters, shall be captured by kings
through the storms of days after
unto the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
the brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
word to the father, and mother earth
seeking everlasting life through this PROFANITY for what it's worth
look listen and observe
and watch another c-cypher pullin my PROFANITYps to the curb
heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
the righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
cannot afford to be confined to a cell
brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers little daddy street preacher
illustrious feature, narrator you select
accompanied by deck plus the dj you respect
the seven and a half combine, over the frontline
the ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

[chorus: guru]
above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
infinite skills create miracles
warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, PROFANITYldin it down

[inspectah deck]
yeah; i leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
wild like rock stars who smash guitars
poison bars from the PROFANITYs bust PROFANITYles in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
invade your zone, ruin like ancient rome
i span the universe and return to earth to claim my throne
the maker, owner, plus soul controller
ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
stand like collossus, regardless to whom or what
numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
who but us, to supply you with the fire?
the burning truth, 150 absolut proof
on the mic like moses spoke in golden scribe
survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
i notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
sound the PROFANITYrn; we come PROFANITYblin through the function
precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
when we die hard, to build the monument to PROFANITYnor us with
humungous effect in the world - we could have conquered it

stay up at night don't sleep on your morn
rest in the day because it's sunlight
reverse thought PROFANITYlogy

[prince rakeem]
child wild adventures walk trillions of square inches
ten percentage try to drain me of my mental strengthage
heavy wattage knowledge cleans blood clottage, and PROFANITYage
i refine the garbage logic exterminate your cottage

[u-god]
thirty-six anger, PROFANITY language is the stranger
the mangler, the PROFANITYnor roll singer righteous finger
when we shine-a, we always find a never minor major
hard to spot we dangerous with our behavior

[prince rakeem]
australian venezuelaen illegal aliens
chameleons all catch the feelings we revealing
killer bee keep your mind at ease, lay back like adam PROFANITY eve
four thousand years in the garden, puffin trees

[u-god]
i aim slang i maintain, through the main vein
the answer came clever, when we do greatness through trial and error
mile of terror motormouth, let the odor out
fumin greater, the temper in my spine huminator
the super grass childish blast sleepy eye stash
the hashish masterpiece, osirus is the virus
this split second splash, severe drop is near pop
there's fallin teardrops, now is it worth your career?
[intro: inspectah deck]
the PROFANITY had a pair of air olden polynice's on
oh PROFANITY, the PROFANITY had a pair of air christen slaters
rebel i, slay the max, it's really digital
rockin' the latest in, every day comin' at PROFANITY
rockin' the latest in ben stillaways
fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as PROFANITYllywood PROFANITY
now that's a money thing

[hook: inspectah deck - singing]
i was +dashing+ through the PROFANITYod
eighteens with the whip, smoke gray
leavin' skid marks on five-oh, smokin' all the way
hahaha!
with my all-star team, PROFANITY see our shine
yo son we gotta make that +cream+ whether raps or nixon times

[inspectah deck]
they call me rollie, watch me polly with the wide PROFANITYy dinali
packed the bad PROFANITYttie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
i swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple kawasaki
everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
i'll probably splash her tonight, don't block
sippin' on lime bacardi got me toxy
plus the cali 'dro PROFANITYldin' me, i'm 'bout to 'scape like the roxy
ever property, monopoly, big shotti
snatch the +cream+, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
used to be a PROFANITYbby, got me duckin' rudy giulianni
like i'm still coppin' big eights from papi
follow me, whether mardi gras' or PROFANITYuse party
it's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the PROFANITYy
but had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
i'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to rocky
kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread
then call myself collar ratsi
professionally trained, i am for your artery
i give the autographs but charge for photography
not hardly kid, you awkward PROFANITYbody
you'se a carbon copy, just started to rock wallys
spark the brocolli, spaz off this ghetto opery
or catch the PROFANITYt seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse
seen..

[chorus x4: inspectah deck]
come, come, come
one for the dough, son
give me the reasons

[gza]
they couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
he stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on sunday?
while the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
all those who couldn't multiply were sent back
no tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
brought to a halt from a front full PROFANITYault
the chemist left the lab with undetermined results
they saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
the audience threw nuts with loose PROFANITYs and bolts
the archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
it was layin' in the zip drive from chest five

[chorus x4]
[rza] yo... check check it
[tekitha] you can never defeat
[rza] yo check the PROFANITYod of this PROFANITY right here one time
[tekitha] the PROFANITYs

[verse one: rza]

fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
women walk around celibate, livin irrelevant
the most benelovent king, communicatin through your dreams
mental pictures been painted, allah's heard and seen
everywhere, throughout your surroundin atmosphere
troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
innocent black immigrants locked in PROFANITYusing tenemants
eighty-five percent tenants depend on welfare recipients
stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
at night i walk through, third eye is bright as a street lamp
electric microbes, robotic probes
taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated
blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
exaggerated authorization, food and drug administration
testin poison in prison population
my occupation to stop the innauguration of satan
some claim that it was reagan, so i come to slay men
like bartholemew, cause every particle is physical article
was diabolical to the last visible molecule
a PROFANITYe night like rom, consume planets like unicron
blasting photon bombs from the arm like galvatron

[verse two: u-god]

united nations, gun fire style patient
formulatin rap plural acapella occupation
conquer land like napoleon, military bomb fest
we want sanitary food, planetary conquest
thug peoples on some hardco' PROFANITYy PROFANITY
get your PROFANITY together 'fore the PROFANITY illuminati hit
dreams is free in escape of sleep
for a fool PROFANITYp jewels, keep tools for tough time
the rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
the sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
the whole babylon, times up, move on
kings on your PROFANITY, checkmate, no fakes
opposed through the gate, case closed
things get froze, when it comes time, chosen ones
were PROFANITYlding guns, we take flight with no fright
and attack, never fear cause our words is clear
what's been done can't be undone son, we can't care
cause the last days and times are surely here
snakes and flakes get blown, by the rightous ones
divine minds bind, we unified as one
half of black PROFANITYpe, we half broke, smoke a bowl of PROFANITY PROFANITY
our everlastin answers stay flyin over egypt

[chorus: tekitha]

for you to defeat, the PROFANITYs
impossible, you can never... defeat
the PROFANITYs, impossible
for you to defeat, the PROFANITYs

[verse three: ghostface PROFANITYah]

call an ambulance, jamie been shot, word to kemit

blood comin out his mouth, he bleedin badly
nahhh jamie, don't start that PROFANITY
keep your head up, if you escape PROFANITY we gettin PROFANITY up
when we was eight, we went to bat day to see the yanks
in sixty-nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks
he pointed to the charm on his neck
with his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
i opened it, seen the PROFANITY PROFANITYldin his kids
photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
plus he dropped one, oh PROFANITY, here come his old earth
with no shoes on, screamin PROFANITYldin her PROFANITY with a gown on
she fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
plus the blue coats, officer lough, took it as a joke
weeks ago he PROFANITY-searched the PROFANITY and gave him back his PROFANITY
bitches yellin, beenie man swung on helen
in the back of a cop car, PROFANITY PROFANITYs are tellin
but suddenly a chill came through it was weird
felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
laid on the stretcher, blood on his wally's like ketchup
deep like the full PROFANITYassination with a sketch of it
it can't be, from yohoo to lee's
second grade PROFANITY the teachers, about to leave
finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
he was announced, PROFANITYounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten

[outro: raekwon and tekitha]

now what my man is trying to tell y'all
is that across the whole globe (you can never)
the PROFANITY rates is increasin, and we decreasin (you can never)
so at the same time, when you play with guns
when you play with guns son (you can never defeat)
that causes the conflict of you goin against your own (the PROFANITYs)
you hear me, so let's pay attention
straight up and down, cause this is only a story

forced in the world 'donna nuclear freeze
through the damage to the wannabe flipmode and def squad
ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
if you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
my word of mouth it's all real wigs might PROFANITYl

hopin i catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel
instead of catchin PROFANITYies, PROFANITY not keepin it real
dirtball PROFANITY that steal cake from stores
that's my type of PROFANITY i be wantin on my tours

[verse 4 - gza:]
we left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
interaction with the wise and civilized
the mind caused matter to fall into a center
a great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
from out of this collision
the central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
each drop full of hip PROFANITYp energy
balanced on all sides such great symmetry
the bars unlocked the power of the stars
the mirror in the telescope pinpoint the PROFANITYs
from a distance, acting as a guiding coach
analyze the board, universal approach
retune the soul to a certain pitch
changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
the love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
respect for the intellect and broad discovery

venacular PROFANITY kicking, truth got there in crowd

shooting out at the mouth without chap or blistec
here's a PROFANITY, i didn't flunk diaper rash
i'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, PROFANITYllow point tongue
dum dum, pow, shot from gattling gums
hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
malicious, with malice and mayhem
fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and i'll slay
them and literally poetic symptoms
pissing me the PROFANITY off, missing me with that PROFANITY
i stick a venacular foot so far up in ya PROFANITY
you won't be able to pass verbal gas
so far in ya PROFANITY that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
and you drown of a poetic PROFANITY kicking
leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
that PROFANITYg on my big toe, as i flow upward
kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
cavity in ya best rhyme, and i'm the access on the rest
call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
with the drill, i got lyrical skills
i could perform oral root canals
it's unwise to PROFANITY with me
kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
leaving you to choke
on where it hurts, unspoken vocals
tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
with toe jamming and ya PROFANITY hemmoroids
fuck the dumb PROFANITY...
[chorus: (sampled)]

after laughter, comes tears

[verse one: the rza]

yo check yo yo, check the script
me and the PROFANITYs get it ripped
blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
had a box, 'boom boom' the bass will blast
we was laughing, at all the girls that passed
conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(hey yo, ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
cause i dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
not knowin, exactly what lied ahead
my little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
get the wonder, it's a PROFANITYt day in the summer
didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
"hey shorty, check it for the bag and the dough"
but he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "no!!"
money splattered him, bow! then he PROFANITYed the bag
in his pockets, then he jetted up the ave.
girls screamin, the noise up and down the block
(hey, rakeem!) what? (your little brother got shot!)
i ran frantically, then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood, all over, the PROFANITYt concrete
i picked him up, then i held him by his head
his eyes shut, that's when i knew he was...
aw man! PROFANITYw do i say goodbye?
it's alway the good ones who have to die
memories in the corner of my mind
flashbacks, i was laughin all the time
i taught him, all about the bees and birds
but i wish i had a chance to sing these three words

[chorus]

[verse two: ghostface PROFANITYer]

me and my man, my ace big moe from the shelter
bout to hit the skins, from this girl named thelma
now thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
every girl from shaolin dissed her respect
we was stimmy, you know PROFANITYw it is when you're blitzed
three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
moe said he'll go first, i said i'll take next
here, take this raincoat, and practice safe PROFANITY
he seemed to ignore, i said be for real
she's not even worth it, to go raw deal
a man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
he got PROFANITY-naked and stuck the power u
twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
i'm not pumpin' up, i am, airin out
hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
i'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
but he carried on, with the same old stuff 
with stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
both tried to be down with o.p.p.
ain't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the h.i.v. now
no life to live, doc says two more years
so after the laughter, i guess comes the tears

[chorus x2]
hi, dad, you mustn't forget not that you promised while we are eating you'd tell a story

i'll, i'll tell you something later.. something strange happening in the martial arts world

good, tell me then!

what are you doing in shaolin? who are you? let's have your leg!

the wu-tang clan, now the wu-tang warriors...

quiet! do you know where you are? show all respect

i know that i've come into a tiger's den
but then, i came to catch tigers, right

if you lay a sword on him, i'll PROFANITY you

it's on again, man, for real, top gun, what what

[raekwon]
aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants
the new range is super-charged, i remains intelligent
back to the formula, lord, hard grammar
this is PROFANITY school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up
excalibur swords, t-rexes, bibles of rhymes
we in the lunchroom, PROFANITY and veggies for breakfast
polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp
hundred dollar kick PROFANITY, that be showing you hand steps
back to the dormatory, where PROFANITY
broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory
true PROFANITYlding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade
so when i wave it, you gon' say rae mad
now it's 28 days later, now wu's up, do something, you can't
it's blood in my eye, i might get amped
to rip something down, the billboard PROFANITYlders is back
so when you see me, you gon' say he gets down

[gza]
from darkness to dna, i move with my brother
and we resonate, energy that shifts in colors
bringing mc's punishment, then i'm done with it
the meter leave way on the fast break, i run with it
it was not a PROFANITYbby, but a childhood passion
that had started in the lobby and was PROFANITY fashioned
every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
check the total amount of mc's inflicted
with torture, from moving with work that's restricted
we criticize PROFANITYucers til they joints are right
then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
with explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen 
drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old
down the dangerous PROFANITYs of an active volcano

[rza]
blitz like the green bay packers, sack like the linebackers
hang with PROFANITY, like redneck PROFANITYs
strangle cold bottles of beck's, like a vexed german
duck low behind the car, my tech burning
neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight
absorbed, in the grill, big pun like
lord of the wu-tang sword, know what that means?
like j.r. tolkien, it's the lord of the rings
this is my man, chef, auto, like grand theft auto
the 18th letter, followed by the mark of zorro
plus a, not for apple, but i pack an apple
shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle
caramel, pecan, sundae, pregline
plump PROFANITY, was filled with saline
her big PROFANITY cousin, nasty nadine
get you on the floor, PROFANITY tried to double team

[masta PROFANITYa]
is he still that nucca? is he in the PROFANITYod like that?
is he really strapped? will he really split yo' PROFANITY?
i thought you said he rap? pull up in the yard, ten sets
he ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat PROFANITYlding
who testing? rope-a-dope his black lotus
can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue
duck when the axe is swinging, wild apache drum
crazy PROFANITYrse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit
can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room
space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker
voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener
swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel
unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional
to the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in
[redman]

[inspectah deck]

behold, p.l.o. the click, man, it's over with
so quick, notice PROFANITYw we bang with the knuckles bare
wu-tang, keep it fresh like tupper ware
the jungle, animal PROFANITYuse, gat in your mouth
polly with the wild life, cannibal out
give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette
or with the mask on, PROFANITYlin' the tech
killah hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
annamette with the top down, wheelin' the 'vette
scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids
twist a blunt in front of jake and still mash on the PROFANITY
face sick with the rap PROFANITY, stacking them chips
in the pits, stick PROFANITY, cats packing them grips
bad PROFANITY with the black six, after my PROFANITY
she like, this your PROFANITY, and she smash my click
not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
niggaz straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
snake waiting, dudes came for sure, i lay law
stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
see my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
we be foaming at the mouth, even, i doubt we leave without eating
so without reason, pounds are squeezing
the lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and cream
bitches ride like the scream machine
for a taste of it, the chick PROFANITY, clean out the jeans
next thing she was smuggling PROFANITY between the seams

[chorus: dexter wiggles (rza)]
if real PROFANITY is listening, the life we living in, is wrong
(witty wu-tang is unpredictable, witty wu-tang is unpredictable)
back for transitions, to save us from harm
we in the race for time... so we won't lose our mind
but if we run the race like a PROFANITY
we would lose that mind that we made of

[rza]
you kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill
liable to pull a knife from out of his heal
snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
one finger, bzzz, turn ya PROFANITYy to sand
you'll be PROFANITYping you'd be spidey, to get away from this
you be PROFANITYping you be whitey when the judge get PROFANITY
one man, can't uplift the land
like PROFANITYod man standing on the hands of fans
see the captain and lieutenants, true descendant
splendid, unprecidented, hip PROFANITYp vintage
started from the park benches, before the narcs could snitch us
he was PROFANITY cypher PROFANITYine, trying to spark the wizzes

[chorus 2x]
[u-god]
yo, rated x, smack you off the stage when i'm vexed
no sweat, i PROFANITY a cold case of beck's
guess whose back, the jack of all trades is next
the rap cuisine, i PROFANITY a raw egg and flex
i cave in your chest, this one came from the jets
yeah, the cause and effect, make innocent blood pour
the streets is like the rap game, a daily tug of war
for rich or for poor, or death do us part, PROFANITY come for test

[chorus: u-god]
still grimey (grimey, grimey)
still slimey (slimey, slimey)
don't try me (try me, try me)
it's been ten long years, you can't untie me

[sean price]
bring fire and ruck let the heat pour
niggaz like ruck 'fuck you rhyming to this beat for?'
listen, life is like a PROFANITYfuckin' seesaw
one minute you're PROFANITYt, the next, your rep drops
none of your biz, PROFANITY around, and run in your crib
wife like 'he ain't here', throw some to your wiz
niggaz running up on me, til the tre' pound click
talking 'bout 'ruck, let's battle' on some 8 mile PROFANITY
i'm like; PROFANITY, my name ain't b. rabbit
it's sean price, big ruckus from busting these ratchets
call me PROFANITY basher, for PROFANITY up these PROFANITY
ya'll PROFANITY ain't nothing, stop fronting, stay passive
yo, pass the dutch, on the left hand side
sean gone til november, stole wyclef's ride

ya'll PROFANITY ain't think about rapping, til you hear me rhyming, oh

[chorus]

[prodigal sunn]
i keeps it real in the field, navy feel on the drill
never stingy with my bills, plenty gravy i spilled
recorded in the history of rap, two inch reels
seven to ten mills, eleven to twenty hills
rest in peace to my brother half-a-mil
unnecessary blood spilt, another PROFANITY PROFANITYed
move with the mass appeal, the blast still
for the cash money click, no limits and no thrills
mad cuz your PROFANITY, feeling p. sunzini, give you
as sweet as a kiwi, face it, you not me, PROFANITY
ladi dadi, the PROFANITYs like to party
we don't cause trouble, but we can make you a PROFANITYy
ladi dadi, the sunn likes to party
i don't cause trouble, but i will make you a PROFANITYy
flowin' high in the mazarati, two with my ninjas beside me
lively, floating on some ducatti's
with two gellati's, two PROFANITYtties, we never sloppy
jewelry rocky, spanish pieces, they call me papi
clear fire bacardi, sobered up like gotti
rest in peace to my dog, shotti, shotti

[chorus]

[c-rayz walz]

standing by my building looking at myself in the truck

i can be a PROFANITY in the slums, and slam shiny
on every corner, i'm grams, you can find me
the boss of the burners, i fire shots if your nine speak
this is true manchu, and who you, fams too?
better have they face in the game, like the blue man group
i heard you smell me, i make it funky
rock hard and kick PROFANITY like, i hate you donkeys
my oatmeal lumpy like johnson's PROFANITYpy, harlem PROFANITYty
hungry wolves, pain's hummer, harbor PROFANITYgry

and eventually we shall succeed
[movie samples from "willie dynamite"]

i know, they're all my brothers there, but they all have their orders though: fight to PROFANITY, and show no mercy to anyone. that's why they call it, "death alley"

all the sudden that PROFANITY slammed berto like,
he had him on the floor

tryin to push my voice on every reel and track
and i don't give a PROFANITY if the reel is wack
i bring an old school mc feelin back
and we still in the PROFANITYod with gats
and my goons ain't good with gats
and where you think you goin with the wooden plaques?

and ain't a difference in prison gats and ghetto walls
that's why we playin hard ball
this be perfections from my father's hustle
shrimp and bustles and life's complicated puzzles
grew up under the older PROFANITYs, sits there with cee allah
came from the same PROFANITY parts and drug parts as tony stark
i understand that the industry be under-handed
underground and under-lined
thank PROFANITY, word, it took me so long to get signed
climb out of a PROFANITY of a bind
that's why i still return around the way
throw a toast to ya nose and ask what's mine
forward my emotions of a supreme rap artist
solomon childs, new york protege
i've now been discovered
adjusted, it was all in my kin, got me smothered
wu-tang for life, my brothers got me covered
millionaire, billionaire status
beef with police like marshall and onasis
dealin wit uniqueness

[intro/chorus: ol PROFANITY/osirus]

as high as wu-tang get
allah allow us pop this PROFANITY
just like black shoe fit
if you can't wear it, well don't PROFANITY with it!

[verse one: the genius/gza]

yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
make it brief son, half short and twice strong
no doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
it was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
lace mc's with styles when they rhyme PROFANITY
on a label PROFANITYt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
eight diagram sword swinga armored tank force
rza throw in the disc but then change the bank source
you can't flow, must be the speech impediment
you got lost off the snare off impeach the president
whether in amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
this witty unpredictable shot is critical
to PROFANITYytical analogy, insurance policies why
said he know that sounds define the note
couldn't recognize, blast him the PROFANITY behind the ropes
too many dope PROFANITY i see starvin
catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
a fugitive bass playin rap czar
smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar

[chorus]

[verse two: PROFANITYod man/iron lung]

tical got a PROFANITYld on ya, doin exactly
what the PROFANITY i mariju-wanta, dis PROFANITY nasty
deep in the PROFANITY dungeon, buggin, lovin
the ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
get your head piece fractured, with PROFANITYer cuts
prone to drops ya, slash ya, rip PROFANITY up
got this whole thing tang mastered, sho nuff
an mc too good to be touched, john john
bring the phenomenon, i cold crush
mc, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
as we move on, saga unfold
captivated by a saga that go untold, like goldfinger
caught up in a cliffhanger
yo i-n-s another code red, danger, break out the vest
now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
don't ever roam, in the PROFANITY city
eight fingers stories none pretty
bomb em wit the witty unpredictable, conditionin be critical
peace to tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
is a toast to your memory
when i go PROFANITYw many PROFANITY gon' remember me

[chorus]
[sample]
the heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
the fists are the arrows, the PROFANITYy is the bow
all movements have to be....

[rza]
i'm the 7 in the center of the sun, i keep shinin
my inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds
that be PROFANITYlin, while my love be sprinklin
we stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin
allah's the most gracious, he made the universe the most PROFANITYious
seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless
embraces all races, all caste and all cases
in every spec of life he's the substance of all traces

[break]

the answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions
of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection
who gives you all and never ask more of you
the faithful companion that fights every war with you
before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical
he's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle
a mission impossible, purely philosophical
but you call him on your death bed when you layin in the PROFANITYspital

[break]

and as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil
like armies of ants carrying stones of soil
building a PROFANITYme for themselves and storing food
at night we praise allah and adore the moon
in sync like the flow of the nile, the growth of a child
only fearin' PROFANITY, we great a ghost with a smile
that which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh
meaning life has no partnership with death

[break]

yo, i've been highly misunderstood by those who met us
they had ears of corn and heads of lettuce
mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings
and eventually pledge their allegiance
to that which was against them and exempt them from the truth
then juiced them and PROFANITY them ??
so the church can rise, while their babies PROFANITYme PROFANITYgry covered with flies
bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
trying to harness the wind
allah's the father from without and within
on christ return, who will announce him?
every tree is numbered, but who can count them?
the name of all things on this world, who can PROFANITYounce them?
allah is the father of all, why do you doubt him?

[sample]

the heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
the fists are the arrow, the PROFANITYy is the bow
all movements have to be ??
the wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful
fast, high kicks, a good firm stance
avoid the enemy's strong points
[kung fu sample]
people have told me
you have ways of PROFANITYing without dealing a mob
well so have i

[intro: ghostface PROFANITYah]
yeah, come on, what's the deal?

[ghostface PROFANITYah]
yo, pockets is fat like the good year blimp
hollow heads is sterilized in paroxide, waiting for you
faggot PROFANITY to jump off, your PROFANITY throne
so i can offer you a tummy tuck
see your stomach is stapled, it's on
it's dangerous down my alley, dog
it's like the halls and i'm outy, dog
hear the shanks scratching the gate?
see the PROFANITY tone standing here for dolo, give you an '89 whooping
leave your PROFANITYy looking like you was PROFANITY
and don't ever come at me sideways, hands in your pocket
cuz i will turn to steven segal, rip your arm out your socket
ya'll little PROFANITY watch it, i do this for free
knocking rappers out, trust me, over a clown, i'm not here to make a profit
nigga, if this was the arts, it be the best kung fu
and i'm tone yao chin, serving ya'll wonton soup
i do PROFANITY like disarm a group, drink a 40 with him
and tell ya'll PROFANITY stay the PROFANITY out my loot

[chorus: rza]
my nina, my nine-ah, medina, marauder
sabrina, discard her, redeem her, for allah
supreme architecture, the beat spark connector
inject in my serum, infiltrate in your sector

[rza]
bobby steels keep steels concealed, be still
leave you fifty shot banana clips with free refils
guns bursting, one person is curtains for certain
most often fill coffins, no nursing or surgeons
is needed, bloods depleated, your PROFANITYy deleted
like unsaved wav files, no way to retrive it
best believe it, frosting the cat
i remember that, my moms put gunpowder inside my similac
my brain is untamed, some claim, that's stunning strangers
cuz of my basement, i keep studios in gun ranges
plus, i got more g's than sicily
pizzeria rotisserie, burn mc's out they misery

[chorus]

[havoc]

and never fix they mouth to even PROFANITY go to war with me
oh, that's PROFANITYw you feel, then handle that accordingly

lay back in the crib, your PROFANITY give me PROFANITY
i don't want beef, i'm like pookie, this is caling me

probably the next to see, he must find the lizard

[chorus]

[kung fu sample]
you just asked me, when will it end?
hahahahaha, well let me tell you
once an evil deed is done, then it never ends
it goes on, and it will go on forever...
[intro: rza]
watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it
get it, get it, get it, get it,
and so as bobby...
and so as bobby...
and so as bobby start to learn more jewels of life
he became more the wiser, and the rza was being manifested from within
for a new embryo, had been born through the cypher
bringin' forth into existence, the ruler zig-zag-zig allah
and he started to spit PROFANITY like this

[rza:]
yo, happy new year, throw on your wu-wear
we true here, you crab derelict PROFANITY, you can't push through here
the ice melter, you best to to PROFANITYe for ya shelter
this a sign, when it's called alpha phi sigma phi delta
digi tech, 36 tech, eject pelet
rip through rap cadet, no one left to tell it
then them PROFANITYok, walked through justice in brooks
scotch whiskey, in the middle of patty, with four glocks wit me
hand pull trigger PROFANITY, 16-shot dart spitta
chart splittas, who walk through the PROFANITYod, heart bitter
for industriliazed rapped capatilist, trynna PROFANITY a PROFANITY of this
bza PROFANITY, please don't make me flip, flip, flip, flip

and bones get sparked, my wiz as strong as joan of arc

while ya dogs just bark, bark, bark
we spread this attitude, to every point of latitude
every street crevest, every quarter, every avenue
i might be on the iffel, wit a 30/30 scope riffler
ready to snipe you, and wipe you from the face of the earth
you can taste it PROFANITYerse, the blood thirst
i start to bring the great flood, first, first, first

[outro: rza]
so as his mind start to grow
he start expression himself through his hip PROFANITYp culture
changin' his thoughts, standin' on his truth of square

build it better himself to those around him
and he start talkin like this...
hungry men have no respect for law or authority
or human life, a man's bread and PROFANITYer is only
insured if he works for it
leadership means everything, pain, blood and death
what night is to day, man is to woman
and woman is to man, fear is the state of nervousness
only fit for children, not men
all men are created equal, so to offend man, is to offend PROFANITY
fear is lose control of one third, if you become like a helpless deer
or a feathless bird, we stand as the true of living, living true
and these jewels, thoughts of great wise men, like marcus garvey
start to build up inside bobby's head
and it lead him to the knowledge of himself
and he became a strong PROFANITYfucka!
[raekwon chattin with shy]

i get vexed, laying phat tracks on ampex

[masta PROFANITYa:]
i was basically leaving the hustle life. you know, going to night school striving to get a diploma and transitioning to a legitimate lifestyle. that's what my life was like at that point when i met gza. he mentioned he had family and brothers in staten island that were putting this movement together, this wu-tang thing. so one day he invites me to go to the studio with him. i didn't go because i had to go to night school that evening. so the next day he had a tape of what they did the night before. and that tape was an unfinished version of "protect yo neck." when i heard that, everything just became crystal clear now. i never missed another studio session after that. whenever he told me he was going somewhere i was there. it inspired me to sit down. let me just see if i can write something. i've never written a rhyme before this. so that's what i did. i basically rehearsed that one rhyme, that one rhyme until i mastered it 

"you remember the rhyme?"

it was the "mystery of chessboxin'" one
[method man:]

i grew up around block parties ready to rock
behind the rope PROFANITY with my rhymes on PROFANITY
the verse shot first PROFANITY who had PROFANITY to pop
a bad weather blow the feathers off a PROFANITYdred flocks
with 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
and each link in your chain is trucked
no ends in this rhyme cipher with nine PROFANITYs
charge of the kiss from the pied piper
i live around dj's, b-boys, mc's
through rap never thinkin' +airways+ are tvs
it was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+rec room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
now his wigs pushed back
name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact
(yo)

[chorus x2: u-god]
got to check out +the w+, got to check out-- +the w+

and mef can only trust ya as far as i can see ya

it gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya

[chorus]

[u-god]
the princess, the pope, PROFANITY, dope
choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke
the man not for joke, we all out for broke
plus the herbal that i tote, the PROFANITY that i wrote
you can't do me none, my PROFANITY weighs a ton
i'm comin' from the slum, wu is number one
i stumbled on the drum, the PROFANITYs are troublesome
+rumble+ when we come, boy you better +run+, +run+

[chorus]

[raekwon]
aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, PROFANITY

sick winter gear, been on position is where
call him an asiatic PROFANITY-body, +longevity+
slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
swing through the PROFANITYod calmly
yo what up? staten island, bush, george
dust shut PROFANITY off, whips spin off
get off, slips, which, wiz

pick wines, lift up, bill a PROFANITY six flies
dip wide, dress my PROFANITY up, PROFANITY six times, wish mine
rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines

[chorus]
[intro - rza:]
windshield, rappers are like gnats
they're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
fallin' down like london bridge, my blade split your onion head
axe that like paul bunyan, PROFANITY prefers the gun instead
bong PROFANITY, put a PROFANITYle inside your head

[hook x2:]
we keep it rugged
we keep it rough
we keep it real

[verse 1 - cappadonna:]
how come the streets don't want me to live?
plus my PROFANITY keep tellin' me fibs
but the devil done poisoned my wiz
i'm doin' this for my family and kids
i'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
said it before but i don't think PROFANITYody felt me
yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
i'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
my fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
i'm ready to eat, i'm ready to grip it
got enemies everywhere, i got chicks that's wicked
sick PROFANITY, PROFANITY doin' wicked PROFANITY wig shit
bid PROFANITY, tellin' jakes that i had the biscuit
niggas be wantin' my leftovers
i'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
i burn PROFANITYlsters and i PROFANITY that dirt religion
murk that pigeon and i shoot the television

[verse 2 - u-god:]
got that trey pound on you, run down on you
hard boiled PROFANITY, clan top soil
my fam straight royal, i'm a die loyal
when them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
i'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
andrew jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
criminal individuals up in here
wild like the theme park ride called the buccaneer
weed in the tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
suweeee, i got all my PROFANITY up in here

[hook x2]

[bridge - rza:]
imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
heartthrob, iron PROFANITY, PROFANITYs slob the PROFANITY quick
this is odd, so throw it in your ipod quick

[verse 3 - gza:]
lifeless activity, constant movement
buyin' elasticity, such improvement
sword held to where it collapses inward
spillin' rhymes if it's shaolin vineyards
rza had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
co-author rewrote the scripture
math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
amplified in the time machine of early earth
a two-way radio, simple yet complex
receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
the emergence of the earliest atoms
transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
same soup, different bowl, wu ceramics
same group on them large-scale dynamics
a wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
galactic matter served on a graphic platter

[hook x2]

[verse 4 - PROFANITYod man:]
overachiever, power PROFANITYgry overeater
i95, whip fly like an overseer
i'm overconfident but some might say i'm overeager
or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
i got a soldier's features, i rock the coldest sneakers
my sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you PROFANITYld the heater
can't push me over either, that go for dojas
i ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
i'm focused, tryna roll the PROFANITY, let's turn it up
forget the cope, i'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
one verse could turn your soul to ether
it's time you gave me my respects just like the old aretha, mr. PROFANITY

[hook x2]
[rza:]
life is what you make it
my darling, my dear
try to make it

if i could, i would, if i can't, i won't
please forgive me if i don't
should, some should be
i come from the strangest streets
i come from the place where love and danger meets
a PROFANITYuse full of noisy kids, boys avoiding bids
unemployed, on skid row, we had no toys for kids
we would bang our thumbs, gunshots, they run
we would bang on drums made from garbage cans
even garbageman make more than mom
they make more than teachers, next door the preachers
they were sure they would reach us but we'd never listen
niggas PROFANITY and PROFANITY on the side of the building
can't provide for children, someone stop the squealing
turned to drugs for healing, PROFANITY sneaking and PROFANITYing
cop sirens are screaming, inside the cars, we dreaming
one day we could own one, right now we can't PROFANITYp crumbs
my brother would sell jawns, my mother would yell, "son
you'll end up in jail, son, or dead or in PROFANITY, son"
but what could she tell son?
that money excel, son
tony got knocked up, now looking for bail, son
making collect calls, expecting that mail, son
doing pushups in a six by four cell, son
a hard head makes a soft tail, son
and my little brother on that same trail, son

life is a puzzle, every day is a struggle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things my big brother do
life's a struggle, we get trapped in this puzzle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things i saw my brother do

loaded guns in the shoebox, fingerprints on the ooh-wop
ziploc plastic bags with black and blue tops
we slung on the block and watch out for the blue coats
ses blunts we pas after two PROFANITYs
starving for a g-note back, and forth on the ferry boat
coming up from poverty, we were very broke
to twenty-eight grams, expand to a thousand grams
reap the twenty dollar bills passed through a thousand hands
multi-project apartments, spots bubbling
never went to clubs with less than a dozen men
recruiting young gunners and runners, let my cousin in
spot gets knocked, my brother locked the PROFANITY up again
another mama's son stuck in the PROFANITY pen
to disperse, no one to trust, back to struggling
now i'm on the streets trying to get my hustle in
cheap wine guzzling, life is so puzzling

life is a puzzle, every day is a struggle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things my big brother do
life's a struggle, we get trapped in this puzzle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things i saw my brother do
yo, yeah PROFANITY
aiyyo, PROFANITY
aiyyo, swallow it

aiyyo we dazzle off this PROFANITY version of 'glaciers'
slang shot threw a gem in his mouth, swallowed his razor (wsssht)
say no more, my back be parked against the wall
trooper square PROFANITYlding, 'face don't give a PROFANITY about the law
take off the bracelets, don't get blinded by the ice boo
it's not cool, veronica slept, plus the decimal
look at my jumper logo look familiar? it's power (where is he?)
yo every fine snitch knocks an inch off eddie bauer
gucci sneaker rockin just another form of 'chessboxin'
no PROFANITY-blockin, supreme clientele, till i'm droppin
kangol slanted, ghost'll ran with it, hippie PROFANITYg-out
club bandit never empty-handed when i brand it
mark callin austin, mark callin austin down in boston
both of them dead, cop in the loft and
big chain swingin PROFANITY, matchbox car drivin
street whylin, role' with the four-finger glidin

but did you come back, set up shop, and get the phat dough
tired of y'all, mostly inspired by y'all
so what the deal now, blinking with us or put your shield down
faggot, PROFANITY PROFANITY around punk, battle for cream PROFANITY

[rza]
you want to pound crab, nah let his hand swing
i ought to punch a PROFANITYle in his palm with these pointy PROFANITY rings
no more said, knew your chump PROFANITY was dead
when i saw the four four reflecting off your shiny forehead
it's wu-tang PROFANITY, ain't nothing changed nigga
still shame on a PROFANITY, who tried to run game
get PROFANITY and PROFANITYs, PROFANITY PROFANITY with persian
bugs watching PROFANITY like the turgeon, it's the surgeon slugs
still pounds when bobby steels 12 gauge gonna pay deadly chronicles
we, held up in gotham take heed and protect your seeds
we fall like all the leaves, who lack tranquility
in your rap utility to PROFANITY with the abilities
raised like a PROFANITY cell to the PROFANITY
microphone post tone like a rotary phone
age of poems and poetry, old sloans
explosive head bullets, black PROFANITYoded
invalid footed ninjas, who full metal jacket clips
and know PROFANITYw to put it in you
surrender your goods and your merchandise
for no purchase price, i'm certainly a heist
for your ice and curtains and vice
come quietly, wu-tang clan rules society
because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
and lead them to defy me, diary...
i need 18 points for my next joint
this high and mointed king, to make a deal
i be the one to appoint, steve ripken must have been sniffing
to catch something so dope, it left minor c-lits PROFANITY dripping
i PROFANITY PROFANITYdreds of PROFANITY, and split millions of dollars
and built with thousands of scholars
my life saga from the hildred of PROFANITYror
legal kid brown in nicaragua
gave birth to mc's, seeds and bank robbers
we drove with pistol whips into world-wide trips
and my PROFANITY's been PROFANITY by the finest lips
stand to tell the contestants, in the world's best repressment
but none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
or my queen and my seeds, in the PROFANITYme that i rest in
enter my dome get blown to 99 sections

[method man]
this rhyme has no limitations, this time there's no hesitation
collecting minds at the door, you want it PROFANITY it's yours
the flavors raw, what the PROFANITY think i'm flowing for
it's rhyme and reason, bite the bullet
niggaz is foul in this duck season
we add odds till we even PROFANITY
bad PROFANITY, high times, lower classes
taste mine, straight shots in PROFANITY glasses
bring it to him, room service, under pressure
and mad nervous, waving guns at the clergy
ticallion, we ain't worried
keep them sick PROFANITY seven-thirty
picture this, watch the birdy
this PROFANITY is rolling PROFANITY
with sharp pins that be stabbing you
pins and needles, needles and pins
nuff said, PROFANITY in your mouth
like PROFANITY was bled, as i race track with thoroughbreds
ducking the feds

[raekwon the chef]
yo, my ice slow fly up on the keyboard son
niggaz ran up on me law, praising what we do by the lords
that's right, exile the fake, hit them PROFANITY like weight
feed a fool, let the fake evaporate
reconstruction, that's the whole science of mine
production, ya'll PROFANITY guess who stuck son
left his PROFANITY son, switch, finger itch
staring at you like a PROFANITY, maybe y'all PROFANITY snitch

sipping corona, read the rev report then bone her
buy you some jewels, here's some food
not neccessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the PROFANITYoo

baggy jeans, thick ropes PROFANITY, sliding through PROFANITYtoms

money bag's on +the table+, gots to get locked up
rebel i's simply slicker, pick up a pretty sister
dig her out on +the table+, bend off the remy licker
head splitter, deliver so cold i send shivers
from many figures, battle the world or any PROFANITY
i'm uptown +saturday nite+ like bill carr's
got PROFANITY in the jars with vanilla cigars

real PROFANITY raise up, mommy get your feet off +the table+
the cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
it's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
blow off them matches and sit up with you
aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
slingin' PROFANITY is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
if we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
take these PROFANITY and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
rake these PROFANITY on the mic, display your ninjas
nines crowns verses your nine towns
run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down

[u-god]
i come from the slums, i ain't no PROFANITY
my testiment talk, represent money
this +verbal PROFANITY+, fueled by exhaust
the bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
no remorse, endorse the rap artist
so flamboyant cos i PROFANITY slap the hardest
ever since the +triumph+ we've been missin' them soldiers
we came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
bulldose through the PROFANITY, i'm in too deep boy
i just gotta love this, they call we too sweet
one of the nine brothers, i'm so unique
every line that smother, the situation's grim
it's PROFANITY sin cos every time i want out they pull me back in
i see my reflection in the chrome mack 10
ask the passer who's faster with the pen
then pull it, nine PROFANITYllows, amorettos
that's PROFANITYw i like it, sweat on my wine bottles
the automobiles with them shiny PROFANITYed hubs
the endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
veteran smile, +dat's gangsta+ PROFANITY, that american style
dig it, PROFANITY or prey
i'm quick to slay with the rectifier PROFANITY, caught by the ricochet PROFANITY

"i got to know"

[verse 1 - rza:]
we don't PROFANITYt deer
vegetarian dishes from the concierge
presidential suites, presidential treats
brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at crunch
time after time, line after line
our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
in the valley, of san fernando
found q-tip's wallet in el segundo
prolly been spotted on telemundo
with more wild cards than a box of uno
that spin like propeller, my dog like old yeller
holler at the moon, my goons at coachella

[refrain]

[verse 2 - u-god:]
i got my hands in the PROFANITY, 500 grand in the yacht
i'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
now put that to your temple, the wu symbol's 'bout to drop
insert the beam on my glock, got that lean in my bottle
what that mean? high self esteem, straight cream on the top
ridin' chops similar to ufc kickbox, kick rocks
dirty trucker pit stops, PROFANITY, grams in a ziploc
watch PROFANITYw the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
feds watch the boards, hip PROFANITYp spills out my pores
i be raw, 4 plus 4, but 7 more
the clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs

[hook - rza:]

[verse 3 - inspectah deck:]
guaranteed i bang hard
i plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
the devil himself could not persuade PROFANITY, my blade's sharp
circle my square, i dare you braveheart
before i leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
my lines get in your cells like 7 ls
any problem, i address you like i'm sendin' you mail
let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
but let it be my life story if they ever do tell
know i died for what i live
an intimate connection for that infinite reflection
that's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
so now my stock's high and shots fired
my PROFANITY who was tight with the kid
i'm PROFANITYt as PROFANITY's kitchen with the oven on
deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
if i'm frontin' then respond
if not, throw up your arms, it's the PROFANITYer bee swarm
and your set, the PROFANITY is y'all?

[verse 4 - masta PROFANITYa:]
you enterin' the 36, masterin' the 18
[?] chamber sixth, hands down, i crush bricks
backs that'll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
classic wu rza track with mathematic actual facts

the shallow steppin' ninja

the next chamber's the PROFANITY' weather)
look out for the stingers, bab
[inspectah deck]
yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
for all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

yo, in the PROFANITYusing, thousands seen early graves
victims of wordly ways, memories stays engraved
all my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
the young PROFANITYger, blind to these lies, they die younger
in this new world the order slaughter men, women, and children
ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
the projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the PROFANITYble
streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
vivid thoughts, devils resort to trick knowledge
they kick garbage, PROFANITY for chicks and quick dollars
i know the pain the game bring, i did the same thing
spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
it's hard to keep control, i bless those who seek a scroll
trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper PROFANITYld
not a role model, i walk a hard road to follow
i sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
the gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
their life and times, deadly like the virus design
but too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way

[masta PROFANITYa]
a voice cries from the wilderness of the north
a representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
or other PROFANITYisions of the family structure
youths are injected with serums that leads
to skin irritations, babies being born with
disfigurations, experimentations
on their faces there bear world relations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
it lightly begins to rain screams of terror
are hidden by the passing trains
this can't be little hussein, his uncle cried
as he drops to his nephew's side, PROFANITYlding his cane
just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
bitter sickness, and left us to witness

[u-god]
yeah, yo
curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
soothe in PROFANITYly ways, hands, solemn in praise
tree of life, more precious than wu is golden game
the wise self flourish inherit, halls of fame
crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
while we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
blow, spin, and sin and PROFANITYing what's revealing
it's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
zero process, progress, become the PROFANITYted
america's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
some love the speed, some satisfy a need
some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
the strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
one flew astray, and then caught my little seed
can it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife
the righteous man would be within these PROFANITYes pipes
take in my energy, breath and know the rest
cause the good die young and the hard die best

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way

[rza]
y'all PROFANITY love dances, and pulling down your pants
while your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
your friends ain't PROFANITY, all they do is drink, smoke, and PROFANITY PROFANITY
the whole projects is trapped in stench
you either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
fifteen years old, shorty PROFANITY and top out
ninety-nine cent beer drinking PROFANITY stinking
fucking so much your PROFANITY and PROFANITY start shrinking
new world order PROFANITY trade, minimum wage, medicaid
can a devil fool a muslim nowadays
inside my lab, i'm going mad
took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
the blue is for the crips, the red is for the bloods
the whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
early light, why is sons fighting for the PROFANITYe

[method man]
as we dwell through this concrete PROFANITY, calling it PROFANITYme
mama say, take your time young man and build your own
don't wind up like your old dad
still searching for them glory days he never had
so many bad want to scheme for american dream, no more kings
the cash rule everything now, we going down
these babies looking up to us, it's up to us
the million man march mc's, get on the bus
but envy, greed, PROFANITY, and hate, separate
though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
no longer, brothers, we unstable
like kane when he slew abel, PROFANITYing each other

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way

black knights
west coast PROFANITYa bee kill
black knights, black knights
you hear it from the distance

(yo) my brain sprouts branches blossoming tragic thoughts
takes bully lyrics lunch money, pistols or microphone
welcome to l.a. battle the unexplained
scarecrows and apples meet mr. constrictus
concrete knuckles and scuffles, i waste groups
give 'em lumps the size of footballs, bricks and grapefruit
make soup, blueberry while dining with classic monsters
better check my sponsor chop before you can answer
brothers in the contra, bullet PROFANITYles in the stop sign
gods in the neighborhood, pistol in the sunset
lyrics, the PROFANITY pressed dump trucks with one PROFANITY
faster than sound, light, or speed that your gun busts
among us, west coast wreck PROFANITYpes, infect dope
whining 'cause your last PROFANITYlocaust cassette broke
the PROFANITYchback tic-tac heads come to get you
nine-hundred and forty-three missiles made of crystal
light a match to those, the crowd put all their lighters up
stomp through the graveyard in the rain, the architect
bricks in the mud, the cold weather is scorchin
for boxcar children and orphans, wrote a portrait
chewing on cactus, rappers better practice
slimey like a catfish, dollers in the mattress
a hand-carved pipe from baton rouge to cherokee
grand-high count, feed macadamias to parakeets
french lemonade, skeletons on the highway
clove, gets rowdy i'll box my way out
poor righteous teacher, devils better fear us
or my pistol splatter your brains accross the mirrors

bluntz, martinez, girls, and gunz (gunz)

gut 'em like a fish, the man who bled marbles
bloody mr. fixit, PROFANITYlocaust and guns
stumbled through the doorway wearing my evening chains
real as the hallway red and blue crayolas
now leaving stains, architect from cali
rumble through the mist covered valleys, PROFANITY alleys
crumbs in your suitcase, ice fishing with pelicans
big 'ole tackling skeleton, you're irrelevant
riding jeweled elephants, california PROFANITYrizon
track mud through the kitchen, PROFANITY henchmen
strange man's pockets, cigarettes and candy
walk with a limp, chance of a lifetime
bandits want cyborg crank, tic-tac
blow PROFANITYles through emcees, size of bowling PROFANITY
briefcase man chant, my flavor's building
set a fishbowl full of jelly beans out for the neighbor's children
two-fisted brawler, good times in the sunlight
tracked him one night, you call and cause a gunfight
holo-holocaust is sleepy, PROFANITYldin microphones
4 dead men in the alley, the butcher
shirts with the blossoms, west coast the gentlemen
holding the pistol, smoke blunts for PROFANITYurs
to understand the language of flowers
gritty mugshot, missed her arms and legs, drool bullets
bedtime time to turn in but into what?
a well set table, third rock from the sun
dead men PROFANITYg, cadillacs and dinosaurs
hot peanuts and fireworks, the PROFANITYlocaust

bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz girlz and gunz girlz and gunz

crabs wanna play me close and grab

west coast, west coast

antlers, hammers and hacksaw, the wizard
poetry of a man with no name, america
cement mixed walled and born in ice cream
holocaust the minnie, greet with PROFANITY handshake
wu empire and colleagues, luxurious
you torn like tape off football helmets, chip
four cups of crushed bricks, half cup of roses
smoke a green and yellow candycane
zombies still move through the college with orange teeth
pistols still pointed at the floor, spinal crumbs
blood hits snow and hard, scooped up in hand fulls
bathe in the river, the waterfall runs red
sasquatch, yeti, battallion with one head
in a lonely place, dollars, razors and marbles
we break open forearms, earth the last PROFANITYur
out in the tea PROFANITYuse playing a hand of PROFANITYs
fist full of grenades, blow out the watch light
convicts rally at moon set, the last
flow stay smoggy, old carnival wind chime
sideshow freaks, belly dancers and gypsies
one of the wood cutters, village architect
eighty-eight sandwiches, thurmos in a lunch box
in a harsh realm, during the end of PROFANITYerflies
flutter diamond moths, both with dusty wings
bodies lay soaked in a desert, throats gouged out
tongues spit out of their heads, i had a purpose
will you still love me tomorrow? architect
will you still love me tomorrow? PROFANITYlocaust

[timbo king:]

near the bunker of the glocksmiths
shop the PROFANITY weaponry, tecs from the 70's
gone with the wind, i slung mines within
my men tackle PROFANITYs with the 7 deadly PROFANITY
neglect my covenant, my government enslaves you to my
hall o double justice and bloodstains your judgement
so prepare to be slain by the truth
it's blood for blood when all PROFANITY breaks loose son

wu-tang PROFANITYa beez from shaolin europe
black knights, royal fam

strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village

[raekwon]
aiyo, aiyo, machete's still stainless, the archbishop run from the narcs

rubber suit wonder woman, bangles and blue coupe
i'm usually up on the roof, counting mad loot
root beer PROFANITY, t-frame, doing my one-two
smoking with a plain jane trooper
excellent with rifles, out in PROFANITYan, in a flight goose
switchblade that poke out the night boost
flustered on the bullet train with chains on
getting my train on, thunder money make bread brainstorm
all this is made for the forbes list, PROFANITY get PROFANITY

stay dipped, rock a PROFANITYed shirt like freddy krueger
you'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas
seven thirty, i'm more like six o'clock
straight up and down, beating PROFANITY til there's blood in the socks
ox' and duff 'em, stuff 'em in black bags
without getting no blood on my fresh rags
ruthless, heart of a stone, born with no emotions
i PROFANITY out brouhahas, poisonous PROFANITYions

[chorus 2x]

[kool g. rap]
yeah, it's the three deadly venoms, with weapons in the denims

wolf in sheep's clothing, nah, i'm scoping a tender lamb
spin you PROFANITY like a ballroom dinner dance
g mode, dress code, got suspended plans
russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance
you little fleas, the PROFANITYa beez and army ants
ems cut up your jeans like zombie pants
hollow chrome to your collar bone, pinned against a dope beat
that sound like the first key on the xylophone
grown men discussing death in the mildest tone
see PROFANITYw quick the smiley faces turn solid stone
ghostface, rae and g be the wildest known

[verse 6 - gza:]
forms circles like the rings of saturn
dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
a wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
a wild fire engulfing every PROFANITYme
it's history, chiseled and carved in every stone
a workshop where skills are learned
handcrafted and drafted, written works our main concern
urban center provided with a social structure
and a curious culture full of superconductors
each stain is part of a scene with
intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
a place where the forgotten art is so powerful
a striking image is something that's so valuable

[interlude 2 - ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY:]

the all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man

[verse 7 - masta PROFANITYa:]

most heated battles, i've blasted mc's
some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
wu entered on the level, then we would wait and listen
while one flashed metal, eight calculate position
the world snapped, once we combined our rap
drastic measures, priceless treasures on nap'
our swords swing, windchill mount aerie
native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
snares and kicks, off the project bricks
it's no act the PROFANITYucer played the role with drumsticks
the warning came unnoticed, it's like the shot "on the dock of the bay"
that slayed otis, the nine-lotus
each one adjust to his own environment
formulate this great lp, a PROFANITYdred rounds spent
niggas bent on a fruitless search for nourishment
they long for this proper guidance encouragement

[chorus x2]

[method man]

talent all natural, rock with the bangles of hip-hop
mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness

gza, ras kass, yeah (what's up, wu-universal)
legendary...

[scaramanga shallah:]
now it's the real beginning of the pages of shams
spit that heat rock, that make fiends make vapors of grams
sham's is the greatest fan, rock big cables of sands
valleys and trunks, i got the mack ten
we can hit the alley with iron and thumper
take it to the hands like the brand new leonard
niggaz goin' no mas, when the bullets go in him
you dealing with a night stick PROFANITYr
the ice pick poker, trust, you ain't like this joker
and the set, devoted to opening your neck
with the tech, as you sit in a lex'
your next move, is slipping, your last move is PROFANITY
as your PROFANITYy gets soft, the shotty went off
little soldiers, you're out of position
guns go off, shams is a greatest fan
a rhyming gallop reporter, columns are lost
white five, black five, with dollars to toss
twisted by the dark side of the force
black biscuit, by park side in a porsche
you're off sides in the fort
we are survivors of the war of good and evil
i'm in the PROFANITYod, in the hood with a desert eagle
with my brooklyn peoples, now feel it...

[la the darkman:]
darkman, my persona's like tony montana
how we used to sniff PROFANITY, PROFANITYw i puff marijuana
try, play me today, i'm a PROFANITY you manana
from, far with the k, or up close with the llama
i'm like an african king in a castle in guana
chest dripping with jewels, one PROFANITY of a rhymer
study lessons in athena, building with an old timer
so i, always been wise ever since a young minor
get cream by any means, follow malcolm x theme
so i'm often posted, in a PROFANITYor with that thing
got a limited support from the sing sing regime
i'm hannibal smith and they like the a-team
keep my head on the swivel, when i serve a dope fiend
upgraded, to a digital, from a triple beam
fucking with me, you better be real as you can be
la trapacanti, a well known rhyme general

[ras kass:]
who say ras kass don't spit fire, he a liar
that's like your favorite rap star claiming he gon' retire
when you mention me, not about penitentiary
wins and rhyme skills, both twenty second century
ahead of my time, school PROFANITY like timbuktu
cause i'm original, like rap feeling the jewel
galosh is by b.u.f.u., by us PROFANITY,
try us, PROFANITY, you die, y'all got gats, but him buck too, PROFANITY
sip the grey goose, and conned it, they know the room service
in PROFANITYtel rwanda, reminder to honor these street scholars
who ask why u.s. defense is twenty percent of the tax dollar
bush gave 6.46 billion to halle burton
for troops support efforts in iraq
meanwhile, the PROFANITYod is hurting, please believe that
the PROFANITY over, chaney talking, 25 dollars for a case of soda
draining tax payers, eighty five thousand dollar oil filters
but won't pay they soldiers, halle burton workers make
fourteen thousand dollars a month, privates earn thirteen g's a year
please who 25 extra, taking fire in combat
recruit all the PROFANITY, that die from where i'm at
18 years old, talking 'kill, where saddam at? '
but can't have a gat, to protect where my moms at
i love to crunk, so what, plus i'm gangsta enough
to PROFANITY in PROFANITYing cans, pimp cup, rack again and pump it up
how PROFANITY still get PROFANITY, PROFANITY just want a forty and a blunt

[gza:]
yo, these youngsters they grow up on the block
with the PROFANITYuct in they socks, and the fully loaded glocks
too many die in vein, and it's a crying shame
the PROFANITYs and the hustles, won't stop as they shoot for the top
acquiring apparel, through growth and development
on they most dangerous missions, excuses were irrelevant
the brutality of war, never changes
and the out of control desire to win, makes it dangerous
fire engulfed the set, they feel the threat, greater than
what they ever had, experienced yet
indictments, sparked excitement, and the thrill to PROFANITY
suddenly they felt the need for a challenge in they field
the great boundaries of both man and machine

silky like king henry viii's robe in late spring
restaurants with skeleton keys, it's big business
well groomed and elegant posture is real dapper
status is gigantic, culture's alpaca
meetings in the vatican, drinkin' scotch with the muscle milk
praises go to ason, the dynasty mr. russell built
feed me royal shottas with glocks, clean 'em with gt oil
china dolls from bangkok, we bang 'em, train 'em and make 'em loyal
trees stank, she come kiss the top of my yves saint

coffee PROFANITYs with graveyard rings, flippin' gs
yankee PROFANITYodlum on the top of the charts
dart throwers, they're sharks
everybody wanna know when my gun barks

[bridge - rza:]
non-athletic anti-semetic synthetic rappers get no credit
pathetic septic lines, incompetent styles not embedded
wu-tang slang bangs in your brain, this is not genetic, prophetic
unadulterated talent while y'all talk that PROFANITY rhetoric

righteous hammer, examine the firearm

empire strikes back, check out the death star
bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
where i'm from, we use dum-dums in the PROFANITYnal
highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
known to scuffle, i take it to the upper deck
universal conquest, kung fu, buckle vets
in a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs

i fear no man, son, you get lynched up
nigga PROFANITY, get frankenstein stitched up

[chorus]

[masta PROFANITYa]
yeah, voice skipping off percussion
give it to 'em PROFANITYw they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
all praise, the daunting, calm yet
so alarming, without a word being spoken
a thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
the contract was took, straight cash, off the books
a major PROFANITY took a don, look, he's armed
with a few black rooks from the heart of the crook
shook ones look while they PROFANITYg him on hercules PROFANITYoks
they found his PROFANITYy near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
switched the look up, out of state, he got the PROFANITYok up
the flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
yet heavier than weight, when my mindstate starts to break, take cover
over rza instrumental, i'm PROFANITY near invincible, it's simple

[chorus 2x]

[outro: kung fu sample]

whatever situation or the circumstances
outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
hotel, motel or PROFANITYliday inn
overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
while the ceiling fan blowing her dress
ten minutes of PROFANITYing along with the slurping
her skirt hid her talent until i raised the curtains
showtime at the apollo, she'll follow my lead
then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
strapped and ready to ride

[chorus]

[inspectah deck]

[intro: sample]
looking on various street corners
i'm sure you've seen it yourself
standing on the corner, is an alleged brother
dressed in blue or green, red and black
and, spouting the news, that the revolution is coming
and you better get ready, sort of like
the end of the world is coming, unfortunately
the world is just gonna get dragged on and on
and, we have a poem that we've written particularly
for the brothers on the street corners

fuck israel, it's PROFANITY hills, spilt pills for my bill
write wills for my seeds, to live from, who take some
who give some, for brothers that was lynched PROFANITYg, the symptoms
never go away, a stir away from colder ways
having ramblings and savages, blessed, from us asking
this whole cross, is more rust in florida oranges and lost orphans
i offer thought for food in full courses
i've soared into the night glow, my hat's low, my roots grow
for you to soon know, i reap what you sow

[solomon childs]
we just land down from liberia, young black man
in control of the pillars, millions buried in dirt

we built PROFANITYmes, civilized our own
king solomon childs, beautiful as black, this time

was the daughter of a preacher man

[verse 1 - PROFANITYod man:]
yo, pa, i got a lady, i'm 'bout to make her my baby
might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
she know my style wavy, i'm circlin' her mercedes
father, father was a preacher, i'm almost certain he hates me
but he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
and she decides on her own who resides on the throne
i'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
and she understands the fact that i'm even right when i'm wrong
when she was prayin' in church, i was playin' in dirt
that's 100, i admit that we both was playin' at first
when opposites attract, i ain't always sayin' it works
i'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
it's wu-tang, baby, my crew bang
and she's the preacher's daughter, i just call her my boo thang
and we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
man, sometimes i tell your parents just don't understand

[verse 2 - masta PROFANITYa (rza):]
no. yo, you mean pastor brown's daughter?
the preacher, the rich PROFANITY-maker of the poorer?
i used to see her sundays comin' from church
we used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
yo, her parents didn't play
she couldn't even come out to play on a school day
thought she was gonna give me some on april fool's day
(but no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)

[verse 3 - cappadonna:]
the preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
she know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
she married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
see her in the market place loud and boisterous
with tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
she a seductress in the form of a PROFANITYdess
never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
man, that's PROFANITYw she PROFANITY you
that's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
never sin around righteous people
black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you

[hook x4]

[verse 4 - ghostface PROFANITYah:]
i met her on the bus stop with black eyes
that's why she said she don't PROFANITY with black guys
i cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
brutal PROFANITY whoopins, always facin' these evictions
so she only PROFANITY with PROFANITYs that'll wind up in the system
them greasy PROFANITY quick to squeeze a ratchet
never knew the science of virtue, ecclesiastes
like, a time for peace, a time for war
a time to laugh though, she never felt PROFANITY before
eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
between me and her, it don't concern you

[hook x4]
[verse one: ghostface PROFANITYah]

aiyyo i roll like a bat out of PROFANITY
evil acapell's fly spittin out of my grill
before i hit the sky with springtime colors
juicy as a sunkist, certain broads double dutch this
they carve it in they wrist, pales berry blazes
straighten the crumbs left on the stove, clothes in my lady hair
plus yours the look gold PROFANITY, the old tainted bald technique
got these vestibules designer PROFANITY in they whips
jumpin out they seats, eighteen, bronzeman part ii
we like dorothy hamill on ice
we in your PROFANITYod we might circle, hats down low in the range
switch lanes, change my tire, PROFANITYl out
real loud on the stage yo, i PROFANITY on your PROFANITYod kid
i PROFANITY on your PROFANITYod, got to your burner too late
i'm lookin real good, draped out
shinin like a fresh fifty cent piece, your girlfriend, c'mere
oh PROFANITY, you my man's niece, the gourmet pocket twenty
bombs made of clay, PROFANITYcapades take place
we PROFANITY in forty-eight shades might walk up in your studio
time slap your engineer, it's lighter fluid to that style
hand me the matches now

[verse two: raekwon the chef]

aiyyo rainbow roley on the wrist, now what's this
niggaz bless this, eight and a half, bally banana twist
e shakes, puffin on lye, feedin the seed's plate
pullin out, old PROFANITY eights to rob gates
major wake up, the kid telltales, make a PROFANITY head wake up
beats break, the PROFANITY would take off his time
honolulu status, gladdest
the rich rock cabbage and dollar vans grands
that PROFANITY mad savage, stationary hall of justice
niggaz came clumped out
just came PROFANITYme, now they bunked out
money be longer than triple life
til the sun burn out, that's my word
move it with the burner out
fidel way of thinkin, roll with the mac bent ac-10
most of my team, five percent check what the live said
rollin with guess vests pedestrians yo
holdin my nuts, PROFANITY thousand dollar PROFANITY

[ghost] yo, the older PROFANITY put me on and had to rock this
[both] maintain three-sixty lord live prosperous
[ghost] it only takes a lesson a day, just to PROFANITYyze life
[both] one time in the respectable mind
[repeat 2x]

[verse three: the genius/gza]

let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
witness, forget his, original statement
even in protection programs there's no escapement
gunned down, we in town, hit king from seven crowns
spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the zebra lounge
wounded, back in the eighty-three summer heat
up in three-oh-nine park, rhymin off the drummer's beat
i stalk the city streets demonstratin mic wrecks
all lookin stank, i ain't playin wit a full deck
and as they nervously stare, i know they scared
they saw the coming of wu, the neon in times square
household name, PROFANITYassin, PROFANITYa bee
mill to the grain, that posess the wu, trilogy
quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
those that got styles, they got identical twins
don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finnicky
without skills, they master the art of mimicry
but i go line for line on the whole page
your unspotted life on the mic is old age

[rocket fired, whistles off and explodes, breaking glass]
[bees buzzing]

[prodigal sunn:]
ladies and gentlemen: sunz of man
uhh, jungle of concrete
yo, yo

[chorus: x4]
in the jungle, we gotta PROFANITYble with the bees/wee
ain't nothin sweet, we gotta eat

[timbo king:]
yo, we come from starvin days, runnin up in dr. j's
rock away, so the mega trades, diggin, pockin days
yo, the aids wasn't in, calm braids all trimmed
army suits PROFANITYed and timbs
you'se a friend, PROFANITY a gem

[prodigal sunn:]
i spent a lifetime of doin crime, hustlin dimes, guzzlin wine
smugglin wives, one of a kind
under the sunshine, movin as one mind, the genuine
star child, allah's style, many say their barber's wild
when i element the foul, prowl, upon the weekend of sweet
i gotta eat, generate with the heat, demolish beats
collectin sheets, war with beast, islamic warrior
livin the mass hysteria, the bomb shell of america
swell competors, explicit lyrics from the editor
realistic predator, the rhyme writer, climb heights
rhymes ignite, mc's reputation, blown out of sight
on the mic device, my crew get nice, shoot dice
doin callistetics, young diplomatics with automatics
the asiatic, PROFANITY a fanatic, i split his attic
you don't want no static, i make you carriage for the rabbits

[chorus x2]

[hell razah:]
we've got to take what we want, let these others rappers front
yo, take that, you ain't goin get it laid back
best record what i say, ain't no time to playback
that's right platinum hits, yo, before the age at
gather millions, acapella in the streets, today PROFANITY
fuck opinions, i'm hittin to the nights endin
a new beginin, takin over men and women
thoughts used for sinnin, neighborhood no grinin
thug religions, expeditions, startin for a mil
stick the student for his intuition
beyond college, street knowledge, got to eat knowledge
off the tree of life, while seek wallets
credit cards, some trust for their PROFANITYs
in the wizard of oz, you get it all to get robbed
price is on the food and the earth's precious jewels
ain't the golden rules from the golden black jewels
steppin out the furnace, only run with fast learners
burn cash and we stash burners
we be the underground childs, mainstream now
sort of like apocalypse, bloaw, blaow
take what you own, must return to your PROFANITYme
claim back your throne, we're on a higher zone
black lazurus, plus we're not havin it
pass the diamonds on the wrist, we're on some take the earth PROFANITY
demolish every tool, that y'all PROFANITY work with
the barcode, bio chips be short circuited

[62nd PROFANITYassin:]
here in this jungle, jungle, jungle ?
i'm livin through, your crew on the subject
the loot, i'm new improved
plus my time piece is bullet proof
i need a bulldozer or crane, that stains like in vain
you be the blood and i be the drainin on
forgot to burn your proper on, with the tool stone
written, founded dead on this spot
you emergin, believe i'm the surgeon
rhymes leave your brain on all right, double scenes
back hand, slap you, clap thoughts, like evil raps
play that, what it slap right back
you was seen, soak the zeen
self esteem, so common, even PROFANITYers die
major league, total PROFANITYassinator, rhyme complicator
the devil and the sword bring death, feed jamaica
rain or hurricane, step on my PROFANITYuse
into the PROFANITYuse on severe pain, strong like a pyramid
nothin but various parts of the PROFANITYuse that jack built
the little PROFANITYuse on the praire, i huff and i puff
and i blow your brain to a seisure
before you step to me, you should of called off
ceaser's father, mercy words, i'm no joke
i cancer smoke, i reply, "your brain and told"
i live for my tech 9, PROFANITY, grenade, all cause of one rhyme
better believe, sleeves, i buck you chicken
make you love us, my mic around your neck to bug it

[chorus x4]

[various talk to fade]
[instrumental for 15 seconds, then movie samples]

"i have taught you well, everything i know
you have even surpassed my skill
but why is it so important?!
years ago, your father was a royal guard
the best that there was
he won many royal merits
but still, during a special contest
he was beaten by five {?} experts
he was disgraced, and so was our clan..."

"it was long ago, but he has never forgotten that day though
and you are his only PROFANITYpe, to redeem the clan
and retrieve our PROFANITYnor..."

[music fades out]
[intro: sample]
for many though, this birth place
of the automobile and PROFANITYized labor
was seen as a promised land
for 25 years, sudden black migrated north
seeking middle class prosperity
but by summer of 1967
much of that PROFANITYpe, had turned to hopelessness

[chorus: bronze nazareth]
yo, you that wrong, i PROFANITY a sky, a black dawn
put your wallabies back on, it's time for a swarm
you that wrong, you get your timberlands blacked on
jungle fatigues, bulletproof vests back on

[bronze nazareth:]
i blow dimes all up in your way, spit a dart in your face
you don't know me in the first place
my birthday equivalent to forty earthquakes
i smirk gray, polly on streets where the motors leaks
kids PROFANITYld heat cause they plates is gold
my weight's in goal, turn about face behold
the street scroll, never once flow, said wise old
elder, i hear beats like helen keller
feel 'em straight out the speaker, to my animated blood flow
pass records around like contaminated needle, heave PROFANITY
my sound heavy like tree fall, i flee halls, bleed through gauds
carry grym reaper in millimeter form, you spill a liter for him
born to take any soul, relentless henny flow, chops heads like guillotines
smoke philly's with my queen, i'm still in the machine
dt's at my day job, talking bout the date room
they may drown me, my shadow too vicious
can't keep them around me, hide 'em under the PROFANITYody
he live like whitney, intelligent like eli
we ride like the genie, pass time
like a clock used for a frisbee, george roll
wallstreet, that's the shoes that fit me

[chorus]

[bronze nazareth:]
burn a building, wu-tang bats all in the sky
causing a black day, i see through the eye
of a tornado, false feed with greater labels
tower of babel labels, follow room when i call the chrome
tell PROFANITYme lord, i slice you, i engineer
trains of thought, diabolical molecules
light skin marksmen, part taming your follicles
twelve men equipped, seven rappers can vouch too
about you, PROFANITY' with me, my clan emblem
remember where it came from, four eye, PROFANITY and name one
dart at the cranium, PROFANITY up your suit coat
each rhymes i wrote, aimed at the ivory coast
piano keys i tap, like a nervous child's knee
i served in the streets for the army of PROFANITY
bring your bomb squad, national guard, i'm passin' through bars
escapin' prison, armed with great vision
god given heredity, better be
the armed bank robber with pedigree

[chorus]

"think differently!"
[sampled singer]
the storm is..

[chorus x2: solomon childs]

carving my own path, taking another road

i'm on the patio, stretched in my camouflage
and my grammar's hard, the wolverine skeleton
i be the yellow man, PROFANITYing on the other brand
but on the other hand, light up the darkness
i'm stir fried, PROFANITY, yeah, i'm heartless

[interlude:]
brother, i think that necklace is causing you too much trouble

[verse 1 - cappadonna:]
my necklace had the whole crowd on some next PROFANITY
the guest list full of real PROFANITY that's hectic
the charm piece made my PROFANITY move like calm beasts
palm beats, two jostling PROFANITY with long reach
keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
chain glowing shining and i'm ready for beef
like my PROFANITY 2 chainz, cappuccino from the east
from the wu-tang clan, my necklace and my heat
bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
universal flag on, PROFANITY, i got shine

[interlude]

[verse 2 - raekwon:]
i keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
iced out cubans, exotic stones from africa
this the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the PROFANITY's loco
jury truckin' fancy spend stacks upon delancey
exhaust pipes coffin PROFANITYrse kicks
acp's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
my links is unbreakable, told y'all on the purple tape
40 inches hang from my neck, PROFANITY, i'm wealthy

[interlude]

[break during interlude - ghostface PROFANITYah:]
why you say that?
it's real, PROFANITY a PROFANITY for this PROFANITY
aha, yo relax sis

[verse 3 - ghostface PROFANITYah:]
dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
eric b on the cut when it blings
scrubbin' chain down in colgate, double edged bangers
on they hips i wait in the jaw break
the snakes and the violators, dracula style takers
we got a bunch of gold PROFANITY, but we ain't the lakers
hey PROFANITY, stay lickin' my necklace
and i ain't even put the dumb PROFANITY in the guest list
that's what you get when you throwin' on cuban's
drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a ruger
crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
lucky my PROFANITY blow like a PROFANITYrn on a tuba
you might as well do me now cause i will do ya

[interlude]

[verse 4 - gza:]
god-cipher-love-divine in math 79
bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
still the same when exposed to air and water
like when amongst thieves you travellin' across the border
the brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
the message was lost in transmission
that's often in a free elemental form
nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
malleable ductile metal on many levels
get you shot for a flintstone, PROFANITYed for a pebble
lieutenants and generals move with criminals
the pride for all in line, they PROFANITYt for mineral
the scope is on the rope, claws on the table
brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
and it's sold by the weight
shaped into a plate with food on it
the PROFANITYgry wolves lie and wait

[interlude]

[outro skit:]
tu tin-to. so you're the tigers of tinan, PROFANITY, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. i'll use the tiger strike to PROFANITY you all. i'll show you the three different PROFANITYs. forest tiger! win tiger, winmau tiger!
[intro - PROFANITYod man:]
wake up... wake up
wake up...

[verse 1 - PROFANITYod man:]
wake up, get a PROFANITYld of your life, go get your cake up
the motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
my peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
screaming jesus can save us, i, i get the bentley if i save up
but that's just another trick to enslave us
push the minimum wages
put, put our fathers up in them cages
then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
but, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
that doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
from my position, we still ain't got a PROFANITY to PROFANITY in
from my position, we still ain't got a PROFANITY to PROFANITY in

[verse 2 - masta PROFANITYa:]
allah said to save the babies from the cold
pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
without action now who can disagree with me?
god is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
that you could show and prove to me
but still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
i'm g-o-d, to infinity, for real

[hook - sample:]
the world won't get no better
if we just let it be
the world won't get no better
we gotta change it yeah, just you and me

[verse 3 - cappadonna:]
poor reparations, the bush administration
unequality, martial law, segregation
false PROFANITYod, false teaching, false education
now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
they deceiving us, they don't believe in us
they believe in that cream like julius caesar
i'm like marcus garvey, malcolm x with the heaters
ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
never worship the image if we were swine eaters
i'm on the back of the bus with two fine PROFANITYas
we in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
i'm PROFANITY-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
that i recite with song
trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
for all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
black fist, staten island, stand up, stand strong
penetrate through the gate and bring the clan along

[hook]

[verse 4 - raekwon:]
wake up and realise the times
that we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
but it was a dream like martin luther
he had a vision that could move a mountain
protect one another, that's world to my brother malcolm
as-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
we want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
and then they shoot us down like wild animals
the nerve of them cold-hearted PROFANITYers
with blue suits slaying our black youth
the earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
we need a solution fast, get inshallah bill
let me educate them, translate it meaning PROFANITY's will
it goes all in together, together PROFANITYw we are
to stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
and that's the willie lynch tactics that separated the masses
taught us all to think backwards

[reversed sample - rza]

[hook]

we gonna change the world [x5]
[ghostface PROFANITYah:]
the technique is ill son, watch PROFANITYw i spill one
peace to biggie, 2pac, big l and big pun
havoc on the streets of staten, snitches
house PROFANITY, children watch as they PROFANITYuce the same pattern
somebody PROFANITY our women, PROFANITYed our babies
hit us with the PROFANITYs and guns in the early 80's
for those that PROFANITYed me shall stand before PROFANITY
to fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

what the PROFANITY is going on, i can't go to sleep
feds jumping out their jeeps, i can't go to sleep
babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep
ish bowled two 6's twice, i couldn't go to sleep
aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns
whippy got hit up with the big PROFANITY, PROFANITY bong
stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
drove past y'all PROFANITY again, you took a cheap shot
not knowing, PROFANITY with me you get your meat chopped
you thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped
call on the chariots, call on an ambulance
you better smile, my PROFANITY you on candid cam
gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big PROFANITY
nigga, PROFANITY PROFANITY, i even take which was yours
i'm the PROFANITY that made you, man
when your rap wasn't doing well i'm the PROFANITY that gave you a hand

[isaac hayes:]
don't PROFANITY your brother, learn to love each other
don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad
look at who you are, you've come too far
it's in your hands, just be a man
get the jelly out your spine
cobwebs out of your mind

[rza:]
i can't go to sleep, i can't shut my eyes
they shot the father at his mom's building seven times
they shot malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
jesse watched as they shot king on the balcony
exported marcus garvey cause he tried to spark us
with the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
oh jacqueline you heard the rifle shots PROFANITYling
her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
america's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
what's the science? somebody? this is trick knowledge
they try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
walking through park hill, PROFANITY as a PROFANITY
looking around like these devils
i'm ready to break this world down
they got me trapped up in a metal gate
just stressed out with hate
and just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
what should i do, grab a blunt or a brew
grab a .22 and run out there and put this PROFANITY violence in you
i can't go to sleep, i can't shut em, son, i..

[isaac hayes:]
don't let the game make you lose your head
you should be calling the shots instead
the power is in your hands
stop all this crying and be a man
[intro: kung-fu movie samples]
i don't give a PROFANITY!

sin city been gritty, ten city enterprise
about to make it twenty-five, utilize my witty mind
to improvise my goal to reach the, all-time city high
you don't want the semi flyin nine at your hemi fine
all you gotta do is send me mine, you got plenty time
mad cause my ones up, and scared cause my guns bust
god's mind is PROFANITYine, i'll shine on you dumb PROFANITY
sin never dumbstruck, dram'n on the dump pumps
hit any man in the face they're like, sanitation dump trucks
dodge magnum chunks up, big enough to slug PROFANITYs out
the bubble PROFANITYs PROFANITYp off the cots to play double dutch
glock in a double clutch, you don't want no trouble trust
rug cutter you're jugular, promise you your blood'll gush
dead smack in front of us get clapped dead you front on us
your back ledge, you rats feds can't front like you one of us
stack (bread) like (wonder) from the winter 'til the summer come

the power from the clan, yo, is more than fantastic
pull pins out the hazard, on this battlestar galactic'
skull tactic, sporatic, asiatic, long awaited
son of sam, mention the mic mutated

rip the china white PROFANITY, flip a dynamite ax
shillac em perhaps, the heart pump an anti-toxin

by my block sponsers, monster tonka truck ya

a PROFANITYle in your spine, rip your stomach PROFANITY
brotha suffer, my dutch puff as sinister as the feds
infrared, signin on the glock, splittin ya head
drippin wet from death threat messages i inject
intellect reflects worldwide over internets
heart colder than winter fresh, chest smokin like incense
vets broken into the flesh, soakin in ya own mess
chrome bleds, some of the known best soldier vets
over cassette, you get smashed like crashed desert air shows
holdin ya breath, gaggin for a bit of oxygen
submission put a stop to men, reveal the foul document
lockin position, invision, adapt critical condition
pitiful you didn't listen, now we're spiritual blessin
viewer discretion advised, sabotage satellites
splatter guys, get ya food ate like i'm big mac and fries
trap nines in the thighs, symbolize real lives
instill a rocket PROFANITY from the inside to the outside
in ya mouth lied the barrel, subdue bone marrow
ya tone shadow, blown from high-explosive poem battles
dome smack, you live, projectiles effectin you
incredible new wave heart, blade sharp verses PROFANITYin you
claim professional, but i never met you
son i never forget you
i slaughter foes when my particles wet you

[u-god]
slash PROFANITYpe, raw burnin, freezin thoughts are cold
ballistic missle lift off, now one behold
my throat harden for harlem, harness the volume
with grief fallin on me in a breeze, the seas partin
it's two men awesome, uncanny
the handy man crook, the rap gank where every PROFANITY nook and cranny
plus four more opponents couldn't throw me, couldn't slam me
i told you before, this is war, it's radical claw
menate the the law, practice my ambition
understand determination, plus my burnin condition
rebuild 'em, sing a song strong for disaster
scorch 'em on a letter, clever, bled 'em much faster
exotic lens, bionic timb's, hardco' PROFANITYic
the floor panic when revolvin, shaolin dodgin
potion of my juice, it's "houston we have a problem"
its basic instinct, motor mouth, PROFANITYld is sacred
the rushmore rock face, one four shot with the greatness
raw shoulders, sword colder, no remorse
the crash course, the portions of my porsche
divorse it, the PROFANITYlocaust exhaust, driven with force
mighty ship back on course, i almost lost it
toss the smokin corpse, seldom sing
shells amongst men, rebellion, teens formin and swarmin
vikin style, strikin without warnin a nation
standin ovation, rap devastation
new animation, the scandal
bandle the best part, damsel in distress, i'll bless you
god PROFANITY you! to the rescue

[chorus: u-god]
professional vets, now comin through vexed
i'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?

won't know that life is over, 'til i'm standin right beside you
it's not that i don't like you PROFANITY, i despise you
the other different pedigree, not cut from the same cloth
stay g'd up from the feet up, while your heart pump duck sauce
i love it when they tough talk, my guns PROFANITY to bust off
but every time i squeeze they call police to bus me up north
sin-ister the finisher, they label me a menace and got

deadly venom, i send 'em, back to stone age

u-god, chef, the ghostface PROFANITYah
and PROFANITY, rebel i soldier for the foreclosure
don't forget about the masta, yo

motherfuckers halt, when my colt, start stompin
thunder, strikes your land with a jolt
your stamina level is low, like currents from
the volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
at a speed that the PROFANITY eye can't die-tect
the infantry, PROFANITYp the weapon-try as i bomb atomically
stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
by this total square mileage of violence that i brung
i've not yet begun to stung
it's the ethics, the rigorous training PROFANITYods
of the abbott, incite overseas to opposition
penetrates then infiltrates
breakin down your resistance
leavin competition defenseless, masta
hip-hop antagonizer, dumb deaf and blind civilizer
with the silencer

[u-god]

pile-driver tut boulder face blow hulk
anger rap book causin chess blade smoke

jaw-breaker humanoid vice-grip, choke
face the inferno, maestro, pull it
pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
never, sold my soul golden arm cold stinger
see me on the streets address me stone bringer
ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in
sweet action packed rap
bite it, stomp on a beat
posess PROFANITYllow head battle teeth tony atlas
wu status, now, wisdom to the masses

[rza]
cock back my tongue like a hammer, my head is like
a nickel-plated bammer, spit forty-five caliber grammar
at the speed of wind makes you bleed within
crack your skull, without penetratin your skin
reign of champ official, wu scamp with black pistols
spent the weekend programmin fat tracks at camp cristal

[method]
home on the range, rebel with a pen
writin critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
mista, PROFANITY, PROFANITYt nickels
say my PROFANITY PROFANITYlding my PROFANITY pistol, deal me in

[rza]

[gza] fifty caliber street sweeper
shots from shaolin that go to masapeaqua

[method] 
things'll never be the same, after this one
ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
recognize the PROFANITYs came, for one accord
for one mind and one cause, that's the PROFANITY son
play them crows out position
you might hear me but you don't listen
competition come and get some on
red marker still bleedin, through the paper
of his sick premeditated, PROFANITY caper

[street life]
i walk with the shaolin strut, burn a dutch
watch street eat em up, cold crush, PROFANITYrush

y'all PROFANITY can't PROFANITY with us

[ghostface]
pass me the black velvet embassy suite PROFANITYin me
spell it PROFANITY priest caught me in the days up on delancy street
stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
it's like the dreads worshipin jah, so ha-lo-ha
pineapple crushed 850 swerve it with a rush
plush the canola range spittin off the roof, PROFANITYldin my change
yo it's ragtime, universal 12 monkey mind
it's like, stalkin through your airport [bzzzzzzt] with a chunky nine

[street life]
the undervolt staten new york
blood sport gun talk PROFANITYldin fort back, take em to court ([method:] one time)
it's the burner shaolin bound facedown you gets PROFANITYed
roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through midair
landin PROFANITYs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
keeps the iron, where the head rest, for the conquest
subway, wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
matched up in a staircase, in a dark place embraced
by the trey-eight, i'm in so deep i can't escape
these crime situations, i stay in man formation
and shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
p.l.o., slam cats like bam bam, bigolo
throw a flow like nomo relate like fidel castro
i be the great all pro, hangin mc's by they logos
my street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno
"you will be punished (wu-tang style)
for all your evil deeds. (wu-tang style)
be warned - you will suffer.. (wu-tang style)
.. justice!" (wu-tang style)

[gza]
slept on this hazardous enterprise
hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
week self-captivity became months
those who were PROFANITYldin it down they hold a pump
do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
got a mass of starvin PROFANITY wanna eat supper
unfair corruptions lead to abductions
creatin wider circles of destructions
so we attack, with the pen and blaze in
from the terrifyin to the fascinating
quick to slay a narrow minded PROFANITY that's hasty to give credit
full of PROFANITYstile overtones mixed with wack edits
they heavily defended airfields
but they PROFANITYies rot behind punctured steels
when i greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
oh that water was my liquid of choice
forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
powerful projection, noise is deafening
carrier battle groups, that's threatening
higher level bombing, plus
the shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
in the same crucial manner but different style

(wu-tang style, wu-tang style!)

[raekwon the chef]
yeah..
aiyyo once again, all blunts again
yo the real remain silent, any type of violence i'm in
allah's helpful most, innovative raps
that brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
we PROFANITYldin, automatic semis with sick lines
run up, PROFANITYy PROFANITY, break down shoddy PROFANITYz
styles so sharp, state of the art
greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin darts
flowin like water, "apocalypse now"
gun out blaow, wow the PROFANITY's wild when you short us
runnin through parkin lots, don't get caught
let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks

[method man]
it ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin in the PROFANITYod

e'rything was wack 'til we popped up
and got it on and poppin like orville reddenbacher
potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
wu-tang got ya, like every ghetto got a tasha
request lines are now open, you see these mc's chokin

i'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis

blah blah blah, like n'sync
kiss that PROFANITY "bye bye bye" knahmsayin?  i ain't playin

[masta PROFANITYa]
many shall come, few chose to stay exact
track after track i'm fightin for survival
before me i see hills and mountains they sway
the words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
i walk water PROFANITYldin y'all suspended with the vocal
what's the total people that came to see the PROFANITYs?
i gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
potentcy, high-level content
side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
all ages streets to cages, split faces
shoutin nuff love to the PROFANITYps from miami
we live from pulaski and spread glassy

[cut and scratch: "wu-tang style"]
[method]
oh yeah, comin through with my shaolin crew
two cent for a case, gimme st. ide's brew

crack another i'm blitzed, let's go hit the next one
hang it over, the object is to stay sober
lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur

[ghostface] 
who's the wallabee kid, stressed out, could never be son
ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
that blow between the bushes, st. ide's and i the king of teams

[u-god] 
crack the bottle of the st. ide's, sippin to those
who don't realize that drinkin ain't only to be PROFANITY
you can't drive, keep my peoples alive
and if the saint don't know you from a can of paint

[rza]
it was PROFANITYt, on the spot, so i jetted at the block
and i asked for st. ide's, i could tell by the dot
on the back he rebuilt it... not that charcoal filtered
ice cold bottle tilted... to my cup he spilt it
aaaaaaaaaah!!! st. ides! mmmmmmmmmmm...

(stop runnin up on PROFANITY with all that wack PROFANITY)

and then everybody wanted to change their PROFANITY name
yaknowhati'msayin? we come out with a style
now everybody wanna imitate our style and all you PROFANITYucers out there

yo, i'm going to tell y'all something man

word up, peace
[inspectah deck]
born with the struggle, used to hustle for crumbs
fillin blunts in the building front PROFANITYgin for ones
full clips, fly PROFANITY, down somethin to pump
whole cliques fly whips, dimes nothin to son
city boy on the corner, i was so involved
so the drama i embraced it with open arms
was tryin to shake the pain, PROFANITYpin i could break the chains
every day the same, who am i to make a change?
will my PROFANITY risk it all just to play the game?
and the young'uns goin through it tryin to play the same
through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire
sent to your son, forgive me for the sins that i've done

[chorus: tre williams]
my life, my pain lasts forever
nothin in these streets makes it better
my life, my pain lasts forever
nothin in these streets makes it better
and so i live on

[u-god]
sittin here thinkin drinkin got a, lot on my mind
is my, life shrinkin am i, caught in the times
it's a, quarter to nine and i'm, grabbin my 9
i had dreams i just, wanted to rhyme
climb my ways out these whack-ass ghettos
i signed my name on the line with the devil
still in my prime weight but lost minds are settled
pots on the stove, move grandma's kettle
late for my job, he thinks he's a star
she hates her husband, she says i'm a slob
mixed feelins she ain't gettin involved
battle of the PROFANITYes, the planet's off its axis
the irs PROFANITY i owe these taxes
the truth hurts, but i can take it
it's a long time comin, but i can make it
no mistakin, the cream is back

[chorus]

[inspectah deck]
i'm standin on my own two
i got my PROFANITY, true PROFANITYz, real niggaz!
stop the wheel really? you only feel me
if you walk the same road, talk the same code
still dwellin in the PROFANITY and find the time to make a PROFANITYme
the few who escape will try to find a safer zone
i ain't waitin for obama, never doubted him, i'm proud of him
he real, he'll spend a couple million in the PROFANITYusing then
seein is believin, my vision is blurred
cause i ain't seein nothin i heard, really nothin but words
the bottom line i'm still stuck to the curb
sky high but it wasn't the sherm, really nuttin but herbs
i risk it all for the cause
even if it's war with the law won't pause
i can't won't don't stop, i ain't got an off switch
dyin tryin to live it just to get a small part of it
my squad is sick, type that you don't want problems with
rollin like 70 mack trucks, what's stoppin it?

[chorus w/ ad libs]

[outro: tre williams]
ohhhhh! ohhhhhh said i live
i live, i live, oohhhhhhhwhoahhhhhhh

deadly venemous elixir
hammer like sledge that be sister

wit all that wack PROFANITY, now you know
you dead wrong, one thousand lashes

[raekwon the chef]
detonate that, PROFANITY massengil rap cleanse that

[masta PROFANITYa]
as my brothers and i reign rebellious, changin
the courses of time, devils no longer exist
as PROFANITY cypher PROFANITYine, all minds one no question
now check it...
perhaps we can go through lessons
or might shot me a PROFANITY protestin
comin with that lip professin, you must take
allah for fool, where's his jewel
was he usin mathematics as a tool?
tell me, the struggle is PROFANITY and i came to build
shit is so real, inside you distilled
back in the form of mist
you wishin you did the knowledge before speakin
seekin, where you went wrong
and why would i bring you such physical harm?

[inspectah deck]
yo, mind arson, my squadren, surround the sound-garden
guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
sniper in the cypher, i, pied piper
move the PROFANITYusing by the thousand, i watched out the chrysler
bombs strike ya like the mighty thor, blast the door
recite a page like a tidal wave, past the shore
two pulls, i'm wild like mechanical bulls
pack a full PROFANITYuse, it's girls night out, pull a hairful
heavenly laced, stimulation make you feel slow paced
i motivate and await my sober state

[ghostface PROFANITYah]
magnificent, heavenly the PROFANITY stay bent
five percent range whippin soul controller of the lynch
mackin phone rings, stephen king trauma down at danzine
my mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
coconut jewels, wore no color shoe, knife annual
moses lost his sandal, hidin the manual
blow the vandal buggin off of bon jovi hits
grammer lo-ve, famous PROFANITY weapon was a trophy
seize posin in oshkosh, guzzle cries
sabotage PROFANITYge rap bandit at large
wolverine carnation milk, wu denim jeans
thurston PROFANITYwell the third kid's back on the scene
call it chopped meat, cause every word is choppy
my logic crunch all crows to death, kobiyashi couldn't stop me
gettin caught up in my world, haagen-daaz world
backflip and then twirl, cave your whole world in

we live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked i
no surprise, verbal stick up -- put em high
rebel i, outlaw, split second on the draw
blow the door off this PROFANITY, like bricks of c-4

[chorus]

[verse five: ghostface]

check out my PROFANITY, baby blue glock in the safe
seems darthy and the PROFANITY and get ski roll weight
we PROFANITYld a belt son, that's my word
spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
i think like the man behind a register
evergreen smokin estates, rhyme and power made me treasurer
with third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
i'm open rza hit me off lovely and i love him
with root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court
for your birthday, the babyface of rap politic with sade
avenging eagle crooks rock the "w" and "spiegel" books
annheiser busch kings came through, and stopped your whole jooks
spitfire kangols, watch tony train a gang of PROFANITYs
painful like hearin the news, like when your man go
ends blow, windy at times watch the room sheisty girl
love to sit out this song, now watch your water break

[chorus: latter 1/2]
[intro: PROFANITYah priest]

yo

[killah priest:]
move out my PROFANITY way boy you gonna get sliced
i seek revenge upon the earth like christ
a mind is not called a rapture
it's more like a rap tour
where PROFANITY get cornered with a PROFANITYed jaw
i PROFANITYide PROFANITY like religion
end at abandonin' PROFANITY, tellin' mad lies to your vision
burnin' me is invain and imaginary
you must be insane and PROFANITY' with mad theories
all PROFANITY PROFANITY you, thoughts could match this
got burnt, and return to PROFANITY' ashes
your show is weak and your dead PROFANITYy corpses
my rap slew the youth like death and PROFANITYorces
now take em through the chamber, watch 'em feel the danger
of a guillotine, this is PROFANITYw i PROFANITY a team
don't scream PROFANITY, have you ever seen an iller dream?
a nightmare, causin' you a slight fear
come the omens 'til you fallin' through your right ear
your eyes bubble, but there lies trouble ahead
niggas are dead, you better cry double
comin' it's that ill PROFANITY rapper with that sick ass
laughter (ha, ha, ha, ha)
you cannot escape the chapter
once you try, then you feel the PROFANITYoks
after you die, that's when i conceal the books

[outro: PROFANITYah priest]
conceal the books, conceal the books
overlook, conceal the books
it's you and i, conceal the books
and i'm out
kp the all mighty, the icon
yea, it's that revived, revived, hip-hop
gritty, this is real hip-hop
untouchable, one love
[intro: kung-fu movie samples]

[verse 1: raekwon the chef]
revolutionary gangster, the will to PROFANITY
everything up, my roots is steel
do it big time, march through the desert and shine
let the c's live free while we open the minds
of every black man, white man, no color, my writing hand
is like dynamite, i fight for land
blood stains yo, gettin money affect the plan
we travel to beijing and end up in PROFANITYan
hoods everywhere, bring the goods and gear
and teach them PROFANITYw to hold mics and grow them beards
then stop, check my brothers and my sisters in africa
we know that's theirs, yes, we been actin up
bush PROFANITY the world up, and left our soldiers
out in iraq, bless them with roses
foes try to approach, we roast them goats
we terrorize the city while forgettin the quotes

[chorus]

[verse 2: rza]
they tryin to take us back to reaganomics with atomic bombs
on islamic countries to stop them from being islamic
but islam is a way of life, islam is the way of christ
islam means peace, the beast must pay a price
for his wickedness, politics is the trickiest
business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest
snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider
who's pulling these strings, from napoleon to PROFANITY?
is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?
the unclean man from the unclean land
desire to PROFANITY the righteous dumbs down the brightest
give his life in this world that seem so lifeless
put a price on things, that are priceless
convince us that meanness is stronger than the niceness
who really has the power - is is theirs, is it ours?
is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?
do we have a press or president?
is it a test or a testament? pest or pestilence?
who got the evidence?
who got the common sense? stop all the negligence

[chorus]

[raekwon the chef]
i oversee the world
you taught me that, basically
i'm moldin rap to be more than i can see
chef, senator of thoughts
democratic cats
saved by the judge
the flavor, that was brought about that day
steaks come out, raw

i'm for real, other peoples tryna to put me in them chains
whatever the topic, let's put it in the frame
we can even load it and PROFANITY it and put it in they brains
i'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain
kill yourself, i know PROFANITYers that'll do it for some change
these veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same
i don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane
precise, 'bout shoot them at the range
but i ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers, i'll just shoot it at your dame
y'all never should have threw me in the game
found a new word for PROFANITY, that was so mean
i threw it in my name

[verse 2 - inspectah deck:]
my soul laid out on the block like arms spraying
the law hating, warring like blacks and caucasians
god versus satan, i'm laying in the dark
with the mossberg, waiting, letting off first basing
slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
this flow, call it oj blood on the glove
above rap, capital g's speak on the facts
please believe that, meaning that i keep it a stack
he's back, he a beast on the track
the only time that i go soft is probably with your freak in the sack
feel the bass make sure he shake, PROFANITY verse, first forty-eight
manslaughter, nearly caught a case
i PROFANITY heads more than base
stack bread when i orchestrate, that said y'all the base

[hook]

[verse 3 - ghostface PROFANITYah:]
i seen PROFANITY sniff PROFANITY through a crazy straw
come out they shirts sweating bullets with the bobby brown jaw
dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a newport
we all PROFANITYldin' the torch
few staircase PROFANITYs, some burners don't blam right
guns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight
full of x, ak's, whilin' in lobbys, bulletproof pj's
fuck around and get spunned like the dj
csi traumatized by viewing the instant replay
spongebob PROFANITY get scars PROFANITY
i'm off style in any section of the PROFANITYod i'll pull your car PROFANITY

live to tell the tale, cause only PROFANITY's my witness
been a long time, change gonna come son, i'm optimistic
i PROFANITYld the steel like ron o'neal
super fly, do or die, PROFANITYer hill, brownsville
never win, never will, yes i can, yes i will
put a dot upon your knot then i drill through your grill
like a dentist, my apprentice speaks with a vengeance
demented scientists counting PROFANITYies in the trenches
that's judges off the benches, got inches for y'all PROFANITYes
we plant those PROFANITYt seeds then drove in cold winters

[hook + bridge]
[cheo PROFANITYdari PROFANITYr:]
first time i finally got with wu, PROFANITYody really even knew what they looked like with the exception of, you know, that music video that i think they made for $10 for-for PROFANITYod man. but the problem was the business of wu-tang. they missed the photoshoot. the only photos they had, that i guess, featured them in masks. at the time, you know, this is pre-internet. if you missed the photoshoot, there was no way for a magazine to course correct. the magazine came out but instead of these photos, everybody had a basic, not even like an illustration, but a caricature. raekwon the chef, there was an illustration of raekwon wearing like a chef hat. ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY is pictured with a blow up doll. i didn't like 'em but the thing was-was i completely understood the position that they were put in. without art we would have to PROFANITY the story. i didn't think the illustrations reflected the seriousness of what i witnessed. cause musically wu-tang was just off the charts. i thought it looked corny. some stories turn out great and some stories don't turn out great. this was the one i felt was only okay and um you move on. it came out and nothing happened. i didn't hear anything from the group
first person that i see, masta PROFANITYa walks up, i didn't know him at the time. and he say "yo, is you cheo?" and i said "yeah." bam, i get hit in the face. he's right 'cross my left eye. "that's just to let you know wu-tang clan nothing to PROFANITY with. we come real with our PROFANITY. we ain't no PROFANITY' cartoon characters."

"the wu-tang clan will rise again

"die!" [sounds of fighting are heard]

[verse one: street life]

so get your egg crashed, by my PROFANITYz wind staff
while the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
like kaity chung, PROFANITYw the bullet collapsed his lung
his father watched the PROFANITYrror as he swallowed his tongue
another youth dead, before the age of twenty-one
left his son to grow, in the ghettos of the slums
with a shot that go, for twisted metal for cash flow
react slow PROFANITY and get, p.l.o.
by the lone gunner, who took revenge for his brother
who got slain last summer by a PROFANITY runner
a new year is dawning, new crews is forming
rival gangs warring blood steadily pouring
the streets are deep son every day is like a rerun
so i reach out and try to teach one
but eighty-five percent uncivilized content
no tolerance so a lifetime is spent
behind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench
killer instinct PROFANITY rap PROFANITY get lynched

[sounds of fighting]

[verse two: ghostface PROFANITYah]

so yo break that PROFANITY arm fast as a PROFANITY
tell ra, goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
to all you slow footed penguins, ducking from these
hot rocks that's flaming, chocolate for all you rap damian's
spraying cards espionage, dodgeball square hard
strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
and a mink in, next album 'blood on chef's apron'
keep a gambino playstation in your playpen
discovery channel, cats that book at daniel
coke blunts PROFANITYt as a PROFANITY swatted bamboo
high school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the PROFANITY out
on the regular for robbin a good PROFANITY PROFANITYuse
rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
hot rock lava, PROFANITY throw the flows iglasa

[sounds of fighting]

[verse three: inspectah deck]

hit you close range with this madness
unique design shine like a deep dish
the beat kick technique split all your weak PROFANITY
yes, the rhythm, the rebel
alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
living legend, veteran known to set trend
lethal weapon, step through your section
with the force like luke skywalker
rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
live performer, bit the mic sayanora
borderline to insane, i rain firewater
tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
i got my sword cross your throat you joke

[verse four: PROFANITYod man]

we on the run with the golden guns, get you none
when it reach out and teach someone, blaze they buns
now i'm guilty by PROFANITYociation
times of blackness eclipsing the sun, target practice
commence when i throw these darts at these rappers
ricochet, hit the charts, PROFANITY your mattress
hold me down, wu bloodkin, i'm going in
shootin bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
blend like a chameleon
all these PROFANITY want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
we can go platinum but then, still can't get no satisfaction
once again, back on the block crumb PROFANITYing
blowing backs in cold
blunted non-assassin, time for action, johnny unidas
handle that like arthritis
still, PROFANITYld a golden touch like king midas

[swords clash]

[verse five: rza]

drownin' problems in heinekens imported from PROFANITYlland
gettin boosted off a PROFANITYer bee pollen,
stone columns get PROFANITYed by drum tracks
smack loud as gun loud as gun claps
pin a crab to death with a thousand thumb tacs
the wu sensai fold, it beez the wind ninja scroll
sole edged blade controls your inner pole
the fig loot, fruit from the forbidden tree root
i stay secluded in the chamber training new recruits
with fatal guillotine, the black PROFANITYoded team what it means
when bullets scream from the PROFANITYt glock like rock from a sling
("sometimes...") pushed through like george bush operation whoops
shots get popped on the block causing blood to gush.
from digital to PROFANITYog, the wu-wear camouflage
the entourage squad we stomping through zanzibar
like herds of cattle, rza plays the wall like a shadow
connect the brook to shaol like the varrazano narrow.

[verse 1:]
in the battle fields mics collide like sword fights
get stabbed up by the swift technique of a black knight
who pierce strikes like vicious snakes, rhymes elevate
niggaz get sniped watch me annihilate
the PROFANITYs got me eating off a fine dinner plates
with this rap PROFANITY told me don't procrastinate
west coast lyricist, PROFANITYa bee clique we swarm thick
spit the written like scripts
no but fully loaded throw darts and make it hit, the target
pardon, me as i keep on starting, mo' PROFANITY
feel the wrath with these raw hits from math
you don't stand a chance, you can't top it we too advance

[verse 2:]
sharp shooter with the greatest accuracy
blast it rapidly, if those attacking me are after me
you never capture me, it's sad to see PROFANITY testing me
you meet your destiny can't get next to me
the best of me you know the recipe
the cut-throat making blood soak from the gun-smoke
have you gasping for oxygen
then pops you with the glocks again
drop 'em in with the street life, the street type
we snipe, artificial PROFANITY under street lights
street fights transform into wars with firearms
bullets storm PROFANITY start to swarm like rise on
dying on the same blocks when they exchange rocks
and hand cops flamed rocks
year after year up in the same spot
total madness synergy in city streets
battle many fleets as they walk by the gates of the darkside

[black knights:]
yo,yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[verse 3:]
the microphone magnificent
burning PROFANITYt like syphilis

home of the wasteland
styles bionic, sounds blow PROFANITYles through your basement
face it for the black knights there's no replacement
you're basic, kid put this in your mouth so you can taste it
these ancient rhymes are lethal
when manifested bring wrath of PROFANITY vengeance
to PROFANITYers that second guessed it
confess it i got the type flows that'll make you stagger
came out my mother's PROFANITY with a blunt and PROFANITY dagger
from day one i knew that i'll be on some ol' lye PROFANITY

just grew tougher skin from swimming with them sharks
broken ankle, PROFANITY with them wallabee clarks
got them PROFANITY still screaming my name ("what up starks?")
i'm a bone crusher, ox'll split your face like a dutch master
no more minks, it's polar bears from alaska
with shark skin air maxes and igloos of ice
rocks clumped up, like overcooked rice
i'm nice, you're the reason why the game went soft
bland PROFANITY, i come through and season your broth
like mr. dash, i blast, i'm a menace like dennis
young coles, and i'm back from a six month sentence
rehabilitated, back in the yard, flying heads with barbwires
stay tying PROFANITY to beds

[kung fu sample]

if i didn't think so, i would not be here waiting for you now
right, let me see what you got
forget the tricks, let's see your kung fu

[sean price]

lyrical miracle, spit with you rap dudes
get smacked off the skateboard for not paying rap dues
p, call me the gate keeper
break haters off your face smoking laced cheeba

[kung fu sample]
hahahaha, he's mad, listen to me
you've lost your concentration, your magic is gone
that's why it doesn't work, you better use your real kung fu

[trife diesel]
yeah, aiyo, she want a PROFANITY, not the loyal type
a golden boy to promote it right, sorta like a ill de la PROFANITYya fight
i'm eating good, enjoying life, flawless ice, quick to bag a baller's wife
with no strings attached, cordless mics
toilet white s5 fifty with the wrong pipes
peeling off like snake skin, watch the cobra bite
over night success story, go and check for me
you rap poorly, that's why your cassette's corny
your money too short for long convo
you in the game hurting, trying to play rajon rondo
millionaire swag, PROFANITYp your boys ensemble
jewels heavy, prince akeem, coming to america
etcetera, whoever sent the kite, PROFANITY the messenger
because i think like the man behind the register
quick to pull a toaster out, starks choke 'em out
we over here, counting bread, what ya'll loaf about?

[kung fu sample]
you finished already? get up and fight
hey, let's get some strength

spread the propaganda
they tryna stop us from prospering
they don't wanna see us grow
they wanna squash us in
i travel to mountain ranges
acknowledge the change of the climate
i think man's the most destructive climate
but it's another wu saga
continuing like buck rodgers
in the twenty-first century
and we still gotta duck the coppers
on a seaport in newport beach
i see military air carriers on the shores
they had a whole fleet
of weapons of mass destruction with mass PROFANITYuction
of war machines that function to secure this world corruption
we cross more streets than frogger
more tweets than a blogger
they perform acts of violence
like they tryna win a oscar
from el salvador to nicaragua
and detroit to PROFANITYine city
they poison up the auga
anywhere we try to go they try to stop us
they spread the propaganda so we cannot prosper
i guess we better sell some more aquafina
should we just leave our PROFANITYmes like the prophet muhammad left mecca for medina
wow, that's crazy
[swnkah:]
a mi name swnkah, comin' live
kingston fight, black roots, youths from [?]
big up rza, mathematics, all wu-tang clan
a we come for chinatown to babylon

[rza:]
if i put my fist through the face of a racist
smack 'em tasteless
would i face three cases in court, locked in places
or shackled to a seat of a bus, a PROFANITYdred of us
life in america shouldn't be so tough
we got western civilization got me fighting for my civil rights
after fighting scores of war, we still fight for our civil rights
to be equal citizens with equal opportunity
equal chance to advance and uplift our communities
but instead we getting shot in the head
like a black man life ain't worth a loaf of bread
"stop or i shoot," you stop, they still shoot
buck, buck, buck they stomp you out with steel boots

[swnkah:]
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

[rza:]
they trying to distract us from our practice
and shackle us up, mentally retract us backwards
attack us like the prophet on the way to damascus
it's like we huddle up, had control of the ball, let 'em sack us
now they overtax us as if they want to collapse us
don't be diluted by this foolishness
30 years old man still want nothing do with this
try to find career and a beer on the weekend
and a freak he could take to the crib on the weekend
suv, xm, heat, only plays the weeknd
only wanna PROFANITY 5 am with no tweeting
honey's 25 should be working but she's twerking
nobodies tripping she could make money from PROFANITYping
and i'm sitting in the back sipping my 'yac
can't help but thinking that "what does her father think of that?"
probably because i got a daughter
i heard money mayweather, he makes it rain without water
he dropped 50 g's at a PROFANITY near the border
a dozen women crawling on all fours up
woah, hey, you should've saw her
you should've took that money to a college campus
but then again, i guess momma needed some pampers
but from my view, these wizards need some pampering
not [?] stop looting and tamperin' with the essence
even with a lack of substance
and she wonders why, why, why she can't keep her husband?

[swnkah:]
we come to unite people
every color, every race
every shape, every face
all around the nation
no discrimination
peace and love [?]
from generation to generation
jah, [?] not take it no more
[?] rza, wu-tang clan, take it to there
(oh, why, why?)

it's getting realer
streets gettin' PROFANITYtter, i could feel it
who am i to put a gun to another
i'm just trying to show love to my brother
hands up, i just pray to PROFANITY i make it out
(stop PROFANITYin' [?])
is my life not enough, am i hard to love
if it's america we trusted each other knock me down
and i'm just trying to live it up
only one life to live and i ain't trying to give it up

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

[intro: gerald alston]
ooh-wee... mmmmmmmm, yeah...

[gerald alston]
see i was raised out on these mean streets
i'm from the projects, right, where poverty and PROFANITY meet
i'm searching everyday to find a better way, i've got a
hustle still to get my pay before i hit bottom
now some might say that i'm already there
but who are they to judge or question what i do, son, so i don't care
tired of eating cheese sandwiches with no meat
tired of watching all the playas from the same seat
so it's a life of crime, some might sing or rhyme
to escape the ghetto before the flatline
choices to make, what am i gonna do
got to use my talents, they gonna pull me through

[chorus: gerald alston]
now with success, i become a target
they wanna set me up, i guess more money equals more problems
they wanna get me, wanna hit me, PROFANITY me of my riches
they wanna cut me up in pieces, leave me deep in ditches

[chorus: PROFANITYod man & gerald alston]

[street] 
drunken master, styles causin' street disaster

techique too deadly
iron fist blew the PROFANITY, switch styles like lay long
let's get it on, heavy chow broke, it's not 'bout
shadow boxin', better punch, you need oxegen, try again
when you catch the second wind, i'll break you in

[masta PROFANITYa]
approach the mic slow, it's about to blow
one foot crow crane, anti-chain movement
restore the ming, some take this thing for joke
serious men deep in thought, misunderstood, held the fork
he's too defensive, too mean, you didn't, now it's a scene
these cats over here got glock PROFANITYldin' him down
these PROFANITY scheming, i'm seeing everything
ten steps ahead, on the wall smokin' my
agent high told best friend of the wine

[method man]
still PROFANITY offa cheap wine
holdin' front lines, PROFANITY wanna front, fine
fuck wit me and mine, rain on your sunshine

while the rest of you fake PROFANITY try to get it

[ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY]

that's what's made, well made is on my workshop
you was unable plus earn advance
just to touch the untouchable kip PROFANITYp dance
they're sayin' of the utmost, truly i'm the utmost
have you ever caught the hip PROFANITYp holy ghost
man, i mean really, that PROFANITY is mad hype
especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics
i became a wrecker through my amplifier
break it down base, treble through my dancer
that's one new dance, it's to my black magic music
it's not classic, arabic, or basic
it's strickly thickly, PROFANITY and districkly
if not don't you pick me and forget me

[repeat 1]
[ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY singin' (rza)]
reunited cuz it feels so good
(yo, yo, PROFANITY ain't PROFANITY)

yo, yo)

[gza]
reunited, double lp, world excited
struck a mass to the underground, industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
wicked PROFANITY come, try to burglarize the turf
scattin off soft-ass beats, them PROFANITY rap happily
tragically, that style, de-ter-iate, rapidly
uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
you couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
where i come from, gettin visual is habitual
de-mon-strate walkin on PROFANITYt coal, in rituals
i splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
he took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
pierced your internals, streamlined compartments
just consider the unparallel advantage
of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

[ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY]
i'm known on the microphone as the rap professor
casual dresser, you may dress fresher
the way that i speak this PROFANITY is energetic
my physique of meat is quick atheletic
remove all mc's who disapprove
that my funky fresh particle always have the groove
you're jealous over me because you're not a competitor
you're just a donor, i'm the rap editor
tryin to rock the mic when you get an appetite
all negative on the mic, i dislike
try to rock the mic but only will reduce
try to get loose, you juice as a youth
not knowin to yourself that you shall be frozen
i'm the mc warrior, who has been chosen
to rock and shock beats, polite when i recite
sulfur mc's, you are down right, out right
try to be talkative, there's no alternative
hide until i forgive, this motive
i am unique with the perfected physique
the objective of my rhyme is my own technique
i maintain the paradise on this earth
with the shut the PROFANITY up style for what this PROFANITY is worth
watch a PROFANITY catch a purse
super-hero PROFANITY die
do my dirt, get away and multiply
you PROFANITY, ya nice guys
always want PROFANITY, because ya need mine
i pleased on PROFANITYw i get up on the stage and PROFANITY up the show
cuz PROFANITYody can't PROFANITY with me!
you bootleggin buyin PROFANITY, don't do that with me
with all these child-support cases i got, i needs my money!
earl for ages, a 100 and down, sacrifice ya baby to the underground
the best kept secret, PROFANITYw does it feel to be boxin in
like a skeleton, growin back ya skin?
when i was young, i was taught PROFANITYw to PROFANITYuce
the science of babies gettin loose
i turned white boys to springsteen spruce
black to PROFANITYs, gave the chinese bruce
i can't help it if my style is foggy, monster boogie
get ya high on my patio, all come to see me movie
bicthes, you're walkin on my dirt
we ain't sayin nuthin
i whisper in ya ear, make ya blink cold pert
love PROFANITYion, plenty bones i put up
what!? what!? what!? what!?

this goes out to all my cats in the projects
just livin it, still livin it
thru the rough times and the bad times,
the crimes, where was heaven
must be somewhere here, though, for real
i never seen the place
maybe some place you got when you die

an ordinary cat from outer projects, since i was younger though
mom raised her children, pops dipped a long time ago
in my mind i see flashbacks, i had no fancy clothes
skinny, PROFANITY, knotty head PROFANITY crying with a snotty nose
even though my father neglect, he pay the child support
hadn't seen him all these years, i hug his PROFANITY in court
always saying i'm comin to get you and i be waitin too
holiday and birthday presents was never comin through
remember at the age 13 i started smokin PROFANITY
hanging out with cats that was older, start to run the street
dropped out of high school selling drugs, impressin chicks
spent most my cheddar on gear, my man was buyin whips
new york, jamaican, miami PROFANITY, flooded PROFANITYia quick
cause signin work only if buying, prices was high as PROFANITY
remember when i first got hit, i seen the iron spit
50 cash bent in one corner bleeding where pellet hit
my man shawn, he held on strong
slug burn through his lower back side, PROFANITY his spine exit his arm
lost him twice on the PROFANITYspital table and when he died i cried my eyes out
i couldn't take it (damn PROFANITY), but the same things continued to happen
niggaz got bust, i'm a kid with a grown man's mind turning corrupt
playing innocent in front of my elders
i was running with them cats that be robbing too, i couldn't tell 'em
if my name was up in any type trouble, my moms would tell me
just like you brothers into some PROFANITY go get a job or something
just a little PROFANITY on the street, not working hard for nothing
scratch i made when i was pumpin, i'm here to offer somethin
making sure the crib stay tight, for real i wasn't no PROFANITY
tell me where you getting this money, i wash a car be lying
saying anything 'sides drugs selling, my sister seen me on the block
transact' with fiends, be saying i'ma tell it
growing up was PROFANITY no doubt, i wonder where was heaven

[women singing in the background]

shit, it's like yesterday, you know?
it all comes back though, but still
but still livin on the block, but still PROFANITY up
you know? crime affiliated, crime syndicate
whatever you wanna call it
you know what i'm sayin? affiliated with the bad PROFANITY
all the time just cuz i'm a victim of the projects

now i'm a grown man, still it's like life dealt me the wrong hand
cat's that was my man be frontin' or either found dead
sound said incarcerated just turned a new dad
remembering them long ten months from slingin PROFANITY bags
mom put me out with the quickness, carry your black PROFANITY
i'm still coming back to the crib, oh so you back? yeah
ma' i just came to PROFANITYller to see how you doing
nothing's changed after all these years
still hustle for some gear, smoke PROFANITY, still drink beers
i tell you from my heart, yo, 'times i'm like yeah

[women start singing again]

i wonder if heaven was a place in this planet
you'd find me right there.

where was heaven.
[shacronz:]
what... i got bullets that'll touch your brain
it takes nothing for me to PROFANITYr dame
remember me from "hatin' don't pay", pa, nothing's change
pushing heavyweights, still weighing a buck and change
soaking wet, rock whole diamonds, no cuts in the chains
let's get the jumped off jumped off, where the chicks at?
you see a PROFANITY with a nice 'what', nigga get that
young rich cat, pitch PROFANITY, you against me is a missmatch
i spit PROFANITY, and sip canteens, back like six gats, so what up PROFANITY
you out of luck PROFANITY, still don't give a PROFANITY, PROFANITYmey

[del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
i don't know, who now, PROFANITYw do it feels since you
no longer have connections, with me, you dumb in
hungry and found this, you must be, your plan is vaulted
you don't wanna play a game, it only works when you young and beautiful
now you should know - PROFANITYw neither of these herbs gassin' you
that would have you boosting clothes
left you hanging, dry and PROFANITY though
so know it's your turn, to play what you give for
your brain's looping slow, you PROFANITY PROFANITY
yeah, you should know, but the foolish don't
you don't get too close, cause you know the truth will show
runner ability, see, is something i went through before

[interlude: del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
yeah, yeah... i seen this movie before, it's weak
the plotline is very thin
yeah, it lacks substance, very predictible
i give it a thumbs down, i give it a thumbs down

[del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
see, i studied PROFANITYlogy since a young'n
so i spot every move, you make
i may not see it clearly through all the street talk
you got beef, walk, yeah i love you, but not like that
you try to stop my act, with your high for looting, childhood retribution
it won't rest til you get, your licks in
vixen victoria's secret stories, you keep within
your witch's brew, for due -- you
fancy as a, not too shroud, denial you choose
but your eyes on the glue, to your inner most
and, when i'm PROFANITYst to your bizarre sideshow, then expose for you

[interlude: del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
yeah, cause remember the wicked witch
when she looked in the mirror, and then the mirror just shattered and PROFANITY
cause she was so PROFANITY and PROFANITY... but ugly in the inside though
see you don't dig me, when i'm saying that
you gotta feel me, when i say, that that's the wicked witch

[del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
you seem lost so why would you try deviating
from what would seem to be, the clear choice to making
such a situation, such as this, now wake up
i play possible with you, but you gotta do what i say
but you gutter babe, through and through, you ain't have enough yet
pushing PROFANITY for PROFANITYuct, having a good time is what you call it
all of it, washed away the mourns of an alcoholic
now you out for my wallet, and give me a hard time too
just to show me a thing or two, about, PROFANITYw low the low be
well don't get cold feet, when you discover i PROFANITYld heat
to melt that cold heart, that's so weak

[outro: del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
you know... it ain't nothing but a thang
see, um, if you start, um, doing something PROFANITY around here
i'mma come out there and i will beat a PROFANITY PROFANITY
i will beat a PROFANITY down to the ground
and, i might have to get some paper though
cuz, since you out here already PROFANITY other PROFANITY
youknowhatimean, but, you ain't nothing though really
that's you though, you know?
[rza]
christians say that you can study all day
pray all day, and chant all day
but you get to heaven faster
if you hang with the wise men
yeah i would say once you got inspired spark
y'know, you strive, to, y'know
you gotta put, y'know you gotta keep puttin wood on it as they say
right? keep it burnin or whatever
you gotta find a way to keep it burnin
but then there's the optimum side of it
that's the burnin fire that's burnin but it don't burn
knahmean? just in life, like the sun
you know the sun is seen, like that
but it's like a eternal sun that
that it is on regardless, you just on
you just free from, y'know

yeah, gza, you know, uh, rassy, you know
shouts out to my PROFANITY wreckonize, all my mia

[gza:]
formed in very a strong advanced post, east to west coast
ahead of time, competition not even half close
let's say, by no means, an equal value
prematurely brought to play, i'll never allow you
to strike first, so precautions must be taken
and what's worst? when you're just fronting and faking
it's a shame when the sixteen bars are just a waste
and every line or word, is badly placed
even dealing with the narrow window of time
my arrangements, are quick, shutting down your power lines
on a bunch of small puppets, with a wack PROFANITY team
that only move, at a push of a PROFANITYon that pull strings
bad boys move in silence, secretly fading in
unlike fake gangstas and ya wannabe made men
acting like they carry the gun that PROFANITYed lincoln
or they rolling with two PROFANITYdred PROFANITYers from kingston

[ras kass:]
our goal is to learn y'all PROFANITY, about this new world order
but i'm still try'nna run up in the president's daughter
he the auditor, ain't let the narc's see this barker
stick to PROFANITY walls like i'm peter parker
the vida guerrera sidekick hacker
five PROFANITY licked, on the internet jacked her
dog, i'm not a rapper, i'm the black dracula
nosferatu, spitting darts at you, out of black acura
homies is gat packers, rat packer
fly PROFANITY, i'm the benjamin stack attractor
mack attacker, PROFANITY slapper, the track PROFANITY
epitome of nice, after rainbo press the lacquer
and y'all PROFANITY is a waste, like fat chicks with little PROFANITY
if your names not ykk, then get off my PROFANITY
bitch, i hang with the trillest, and that's why 5 percenters,
college kids and ex- felons feel this
i'm sick with the words, waterproofing liquid swords
the world never heard this before, call me mr. more
cause more money, more PROFANITY, and more spit to serve

i speak from the root of our self-esteem
let me embrace that
holding you captive
you're so attractive
so let me taste that
and beat it up real good until you say cat
you're not a PROFANITYod rat

lost PROFANITY couldn't PROFANITYble in this wild jungle
quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
divine master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed

this powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant
was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
un-filled rifle, scout PROFANITY, shots precise

[chorus 2x: freda payne sample]

shame on a PROFANITY, i heard the reaper done came to get ya
so i done copped a fifth of, PROFANITY, and in your PROFANITYnor
i've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
music got us up off them PROFANITY corners
now i'mma swallow this whole bottle for ol' PROFANITY
damn, it's hurts me, i hate it when brother's go early

[chorus 2x]

[raekwon]
word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
in his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to wu
us forming like a family, you just blew
you was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
you the pearl in the ocean, i'm up on the land, PROFANITY
now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this PROFANITY
i know it's real, guess i slept with the black jesus

[chorus 2x]

[gza]
i became weak when i heard, that his PROFANITYy expired
it was hard for me to believe my brother retired
suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
how can he walk off the field during the first inning?
i cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
hate not being there, the minutes before he left
now i'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
i think about him on this song and what he might've said

[chorus 2x]

[masta PROFANITYa]
when i first heard the word, i needed air to clear my head
i know you didn't say what i thought you said, my brother's dead
you crazy, another PROFANITY prank to get the family cranked
ya'll PROFANITY shouldn't play like that, i know PROFANITYw you feel
lord, but it's real, and i still can't believe
and my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
ason unique, loved wine and fine women
we singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw" (we like it raw)

[chorus 2x]

[interlude: inspectah deck - over PROFANITYok]
can't pretend...
some day it gotta come to an end
but i'ma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
yeah...

[inspectah deck]
i popped a bottle on your born day, PROFANITY
tried hard not to cry, i still can't hide the scar
and i still ask, why to PROFANITY, PROFANITYyzing your form
as i stood there beside your mom
and i share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
should've, would've, could've, had the time, i was selfish
i carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
i really miss you russell, PROFANITYpe you forgive me PROFANITY

[chorus 2x]

[u-god]
yo, these walls i wanna crash, and put my fists through
shout out to PROFANITY, let the whole world miss you
reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
i dropped tears and watch my PROFANITY fall from greatness
it's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
soon as the news hit me, i bust out with pain and
rivers i cried, my brother just died
i'mma see you, my PROFANITY, on the other side

[chorus 2x]

[rza]
ah, man, PROFANITYw do i say goodbye?
it's always the good ones that have to die
it's hard to live without you, PROFANITY, i shouldn't have doubt you
when you said that the passion of christ was all about you
from the PROFANITY mobile, to linden plaza, to brownsville
florida to ohio, to putnam, to park hill
you interrupt the grammy's said "wu for the kids"
took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
trey-five-seven PROFANITYed ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
you've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
crashed cars, still came out without a scar
they tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
so you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
how we treat them PROFANITYs? dirt, PROFANITYw we treat them hoes?
we PROFANITY 'em in the PROFANITY, dirt

[chorus]

[freda payne sample]
but those mistakes behind me
cast shadows to remind me

damn we got to slow this PROFANITY down man, yaknowhatimean?

[tekitha]
fiends were never waiting in the hill
they ran one step ahead
but the jiggy was always there

upon the project pavement
there was death, enslavement of the mind
single mothers are filled with stress

as i lay there with my baby
we would look, from the window, and cry
then suddenly in the sky

between the new world ages
we were blessed, and wu-tang fills the ear
with the melody of a train (lord is suddenly here!)

false mc's are melting
in the dark, all the weak lp's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn

god released the tape out, early may

and, i don't think the world can take it
cause it took so long to make it
and the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme

wu-tang, wu-tang, wu-tang

upon the project pavement
there was death, enslavement of the mind
single mothers are filled with stress

between the new world ages
we were blessed, and wu-tang fills the air
with the knowledge that PROFANITY posess

as i lay there with my baby
we would look, from the window, and cry
then the wu-tang sign appears, in the sky

billboards started melting
in the dark, all the weak mc's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwn

god released the tape of, earthly pain

and, i don't think the world can take it
cause it took so long to make it
and the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme

massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears
cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair
so lather the soap, coconut conditioning
honey lather, blood flowing, love glistening
motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean
lovers, bath crystals, lovers bun scrubbers
hot milk bath, steam shower rubbing
these will splash long loving in your oven
make it off, break it off, till it gets soft
passion fruit, PROFANITY cat, want to touch it off
in and out, PROFANITYs patients, hershey's kisses get a style
stress reliever soak your feet, air them out
brain message, think about pink
stress relieving, no dishes in the sink
upper lower, left, right, neck don't play
back rub, count on, take me away
waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish
come with me through all the PROFANITY madness
night breeze at sea, sipping tea
you and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees
jet skis breeze
scraping water on chocolate, PROFANITYer scotch flowers
vapor action, tropical sunshower
baby powder, relax, feel for an PROFANITYur
sand suntan, snuggled up snug
snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug
thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance
chemical stimuli, two PROFANITYs off the chalace
complete silence, what surround us
whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
vanilla apple heat, loop played jazz music, coffee pillow sleeps
breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
sunset level, suprise sunrises, PROFANITY
lay on the couch, while i clip your toenails
dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
soft spoken gospel, barry white acapell
violin, good medicine, sound swell
sunshine like, the right, without the PROFANITY
taste sugar, wise storm steam stick
slowdance drink, like nights over egypt
having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
company, ice cream licking now we PROFANITYlding
gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
alcohol, palm trees, peanut PROFANITYer jelly
almond twirl, fantastic melodies

wiping me with toon, fly wine, prize storm
now it's high noon, rasberry PROFANITYes
cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
sounds of the shore, every winter is a war
paradise life, recipe now pour

i got close, whispered "what's up with the bar mitzvah?"
then i grabbed her PROFANITY, she laughed with a PROFANITY look
and PROFANITY popped her PROFANITY on rhythm with the beat

[chorus x6]
[verse one: u-god]

insert the spasm, yes the PROFANITY hurt has them
thoroughbred PROFANITYs insert the fantasm
verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
exotic wine, PROFANITYlding nine, picasso pictures

bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
words seem to zing on down to bejing
when we touch down you crown renowned kings

[verse two: PROFANITYod man]

there's no PROFANITYnor amongst theives, street pharmaceutical
stack like genovese, the four devil tempt mad men
but not these, we profound PROFANITY sound

and spread fear through this rap city, call the mayor

the smell of fear makes my nostrils -- flair, truth or dare
ask yourself can you compare

it's common sense PROFANITYw i master my circum-fer-ence, you dense
i get locked the PROFANITY up, released on my own recognizance
can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
wu-tang harvest one thousand notches above
mc level, yo, i stay high as like treble
foes who oppose get plucked like rose pedals
arresting and PROFANITYlding, PROFANITY for better regions
wack mc's only lasted one season
the morale was low at the corral
adjective PROFANITYouns had no style, yo, we propose our
aim the official, initial, is ruler zig-zag-zig allah
all that other PROFANITY ain't permissable
annual increase of the wu-tang manual
handles to a keyboard is true hip PROFANITYp set tangible
illegible, every egg ain't edible
my tracks remain unforgettable, like ol' nat cole
got to catch this paper to buy shaquasia a glacier
throw chairs to deck a skyscraper
understand that the continents of africa and asia
and free the black man from the enslaved labor, wu-tang

[interlude: masta PROFANITYa, PROFANITYod man, raekwon]

the weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nuttin

about my PROFANITY habits, i got to have it, the super-glow
deuce bigelow - male PROFANITY
gold hands crush PROFANITY cans and michelobs
style is nino, black benzito, valentino
nine needles - voice; evil steelo
hit, like the bull, more pull than magneto
crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the eagle
nine PROFANITY strikes, leaped up off all you people
burn therapy, chemo, seap PROFANITYs
see you through the PROFANITYphole - in the crime lab
countin ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
then he bagged up chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up reemo
gambino three dice, headcrack cee-lo
in ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
lower than low, lower than zero
who's your rhymin heroes? *heavy breathing*
("killa beeeeeeeeeeees?")

bobby digital, half-man and half-cyborg
ny city, PROFANITYme of the fly bitties
with high-heel shoes and tattoos on side PROFANITY
shorties swallow up the apple cider
ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow spyder
with the black interior, my mack superior
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
i used to cut class and bang lunch tables
with four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
now i'm known to smack drum machines, carry +guillotines+
watch my bullets scream ("pheeewwwwww!") and hit the target
you can't trace the path of air for richard starlett

[hook: suga bang bang]
you're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
you're no warrior, ya not so devious

[inspectah deck:]
it's the return of the bad boy, the mic sean penn
floss gems across the globe with my nine sourceman
at a speed that excedes your convertible benz
from a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
stay PROFANITYtter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
killa squadron, known to start a popular trend
and the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
kings of our kindom, reppin from our PROFANITYodlums
gotta whip them problems, cuz yo we step on toes
bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros

shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
superbad, who am i?  dolemite classic
the vandal's back, hands on angela bassett
i handle my plastic, gunplay i mastered
no PROFANITY, dope mixed down with acid on record
broken down and crafted in seconds
lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
better, respect it, PROFANITY believe
i pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
i air out the showroom, the PROFANITY can breathe
fix your weave, behold my expertise

[chorus: wu-tang clan]

[chorus]

[ghostface PROFANITYah]
yo what the PROFANITY yo?!  yo what the PROFANITY y'all comin for?

we got big guns in here, PROFANITY over there
with blue bag and e pills stashed under the chair
and there's boss PROFANITYg black and white pit with the pink lips
stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
the PROFANITY had me dyin yo, big fat PROFANITY bleedin
big cat PROFANITY all season
on the beach truck, stuck with hawaiian ice
diamond twice the whole city thought i bought fubu
blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
eighteen karat rap between noodles

[chorus]

[rza]
up at PROFANITYa bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
i saw (?) sippin henny from a iced out cup
yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
i sit took, three drags off the PROFANITYney-dip
now what you talkin?  you see my gold fronts sparkin?
ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
read the headline, that was blast on today's post
dead king, thought he could ace ghost
queen, couldn't even jack monk
probably find him in doc doom's back trunk
bdoodoodoo!  i'm up at the wu library
readin malcolm's, ".. any means necessary"

[method man]
john john, bacardi straight up PROFANITYld the ice
so nice like new york they had to name him twice
name your price, i black out then change the lights
give you the same advice that i gave my wife
don't PROFANITY with mine, clan give you lumps in nine
let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

[inspectah deck]
new york, new york, legendary rhyme boss
code name charley PROFANITYrse, bust with blind force
i smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check

i dance on a PROFANITY like my name's zab judah
rap barracuda, three xl kahuna
sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
i'm thirstin, feel what i feel then we can merge then
creep it through the states in v8's and 12's
my weight's PROFANITY, PROFANITY with me then brace yourself
the PROFANITYle, sir i mass mogul
known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

[masta PROFANITYa]
this is grown man talkin, coward i split your head
i'm from the east where the streets run red from the bloodshed
hit chef for the rice and peas
nuff respect father e tumbled at ease
my brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
they need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
floatin on the 95, sting like a PROFANITYer bee
your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

[gza]
from dark matter to the big crunch
the vocals came in a bunch without one punch
rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
so you compare contrast but don't blast
through extreme depths, with the pen i PROFANITYld fast
watch the block thirst for one became all
shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
the blind couldn't verify the authenticity
the rhyme came from the pressure of heat
then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

[chorus]

[scratching "soooooooooooo" until fade]
these things just took over me
just took over my whole PROFANITYy
so i can't even see no more

save the children
they don't know who the true living PROFANITY is
and all the orchards in the world

so they worship what they know not
and let evil lead them in the wrong direction
far fewer men than right
now you got the ten percent
who are rich PROFANITY PROFANITY of the poor
who teach the poor lies
to make the people believe
that the old mighty true living PROFANITY
is a PROFANITY in the sky
save the children
and you can't see him with the physical eyes
they're also known as blood PROFANITYers of the poor
save the children
and then you got the five percent
who are the poor righteous people who do not believe
the teachers of the ten percent
save the children
who is all wise and know that the true
and living PROFANITY, and teach that the true
and living PROFANITY is supreme being black
man from within
otherwise known as civilized people
also muslims, and muslims sons
peace we out

aimed at windshields, gas tanks and wheels
from the bank they yanked the mil, PROFANITYt lead and stainless steel
shot through the helments, PROFANITYed heads like halibut jaw
ripped through the wolves and blew the PROFANITYod off the car
a.t.f., f.b.i., d.e.a., chopper in the sky
eye witness news on standby

richard dale took his PROFANITY, off the wall pullin his whip
mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater

niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better
but i do, true, can i get a "sue"
nuff respect due to the one-six-oh
i mean oh, you check out the flow
like the hudson or PROFANITY when i'm dusting

[ol PROFANITY PROFANITY] c'mon baby baby c'mon [4x]
[rza] yo, you best protect your neck

[ol PROFANITY PROFANITY]
first things first man you're PROFANITY with the worst
i'll be sticking pins in your head like a PROFANITY nurse
i'll attack any PROFANITY who's slack in his mack
come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
shame on you when you stepped through to
the ol PROFANITY PROFANITY straight from the brooklyn zoo
and i'll be PROFANITY if i let any man
come to my center, you enter the winter
straight up and down that PROFANITY packed jam
you can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man
the ol PROFANITY PROFANITY is dirty and stinking
ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps
niggaz be rolling with a stash
ain't saying cash, bite my style i'll bite your PROFANITY PROFANITY!

[ghostface PROFANITYah]
for crying out loud my style is wild so book me
not long is PROFANITYw long that this rhyme took me
ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
here's mordigan, catch it like a PROFANITY flashback
i love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
i come with PROFANITY that's all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stomping grounds
i give a order to my PROFANITYps across the water
to go and PROFANITY up props all around the border
and get far like a shooting star
'cause who i am is dim in the light of pablo escobar
point blank as i kick the square biz
there it is you're PROFANITY with pros and there it goes

[rza]
you chill with the feedback black we don't need that
it's ten o'clock PROFANITY, where the PROFANITY's your seed at?
feeling mad PROFANITYstile, ran the apostle
flowing like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the PROFANITYly roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
turn the other cheek and i'll break your PROFANITY chin
slaying boom-bangs like african drums (we'll be)
coming around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
my clan increase like black unemployment
yeah, another one dare,
tuh-took a genius (to) take us the PROFANITY outta here

[genius]
the wu is too slamming for these cold PROFANITYing labels
some ain't had hits since i seen aunt mabel
be doing artists in like cain did abel
now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
that's what you get when you misuse what i invent
your empire falls and you lose every cent
for trying to blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
should've pumped it when i rocked it
niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors they're scared to death to pump these
first of all, who's your a&r
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
but he don't know the meaning of dope
when he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
and i'm the dirtiest thing in sight
matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

[sounds of fighting]

[rza] you best protect your neck [4x]
"who's the knucklehead wantin respect?" -- [ghostface]

a second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision
you can't knock the hustle or the life that i'm livin
quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position
street juridictions, PROFANITY, no restriction
concrete composition for emcee's in submission
special edition crash course mission
push through like the task force and crush all competition
see you from a distance, dry snitchin, whisperin
greet your man posted up like two little PROFANITY
when you get the heart, step live or catch stitches
or find yourself with del, sleepin with the fishes
i got no love for fans that's fake PROFANITY PROFANITY
i can't stand the bid when it's all in my business
wu-tang forever and a day, don't get it twisted
i get lifted, i just shoot somethin from PROFANITYt buscuit

ninja coma, pirahnas PROFANITY teeth on my armor
scadalous, i ran contra-bomber, stalker like rebels of rwanda
death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama
godfather 4 type saga, tuckin a revolver in my parker
bombin unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder
fear the bow of the silent archer
sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter
poison darter, news photographers document the PROFANITYrror
while i bounce shaunda with tiwana and i from blue PROFANITYnda
honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar
your highnes, the crowd PROFANITYllar
got your head rock, feel the brain trauma
crowd sponser, PROFANITYtter than bahama steam saunas
the rebel of opera, popped off the choclate and the ?gosha?
monster truck crush you imposters

yeah, bank robbers armored up, gear like the boys in heat
deniro told one soul to keep quiet

[interlude: cormega]
aiyo, word to mother
ya'll PROFANITY better bring ya selfs son, word

[cormega]
when pun was packing a mack in back of the acura
i was dealing in them buildings, it wasn't no cameras
the witness savages, snitching was hazardous, now it isin't
shit is embarrasing, PROFANITY a flow, this is a lyrical aquaduct
sink or swim for what i'm hearing you bagging up
lyte like the mc, i'm 'paper thin', you tripping
i'm taking trips, your eyes don't lie, take a glimpse
into my life, you see me blazing clips, with the green to make it rich
with a team that'll scrape the knicks, and a v that's crazy quick
i came to wear my yankee fitted, represent for greatness
it's lyrical elevation, causing mental stimulation
if i'm getting too deep, i give you a minute to take in
my jewels radiant, like a view of the caymans
and thinking you seeing me, who you playing with?
cor, mega, raw forever
fell back, pause, fell off? never

[interlude: sean price]
p! shaolin, what up?

[sean price]
aiyo, listen giraffe neck PROFANITY, i blast techs
alejandro, came through with the mexican aztecs
rap smack PROFANITY on a whole different aspect
homey, owe me dough, that's PROFANITYw we PROFANITY up his last check
three train saratoga, train stop, PROFANITY been
metro part with the plan, make major figures
foul flagrant, two shots, give me the ball back
you got shot, get off my PROFANITY
you not PROFANITYt, give me a call back, PROFANITY is all wack
super doopa PROFANITY, get drugs and i fall back
p, ain't a problem that the PROFANITY can't handle
i set it off first blood, sean john rambo
whoooo, as you can see, i'm focused
boot camp for life, PROFANITY the g.i. joe PROFANITY
boot camp is an army, better yet a navy
marine air force ones, PROFANITY, the PROFANITY's crazy, don't play me
[verse 1: too poetic/grym reaper]
yo, hah yo, rahh, yo, yo
yo, yo, yo...
yo, i got stress on my brain that causes chest pains
inside the best frames ghetto blood clots is scored by slug shots
and drug spots, well if you're too poor to move out
or get a new PROFANITYuse, it's like livin in a war walkin through shootouts
and you doubt PROFANITY exists, when hard fists
be poundin on your head like jackhammers
you're trapped in the black drama, you hear the laughter
seconds after that you fade out, you're played out, you're laid out
your heart nearly gave out, you're lucky that you made out
with just a few scars when the beating ends
the streets [sniff] let ya breathe again
but evil men, will soon be on the receiving end
of universal law, i'm callin on the meek and the poor
to fight back and never forfeit the day you have to go to war
with forces that are armed upon the seven continental borders
a mental fortress is essentials to absorb this
my sword hits the human orb until it orbits
in the art of war kids see grym reap be morbid
since pieces of the lost civilization in the past
had my photographs etched inside of pyramids
to laugh at this revelation, without 365 days of concentration
and twenty-four PROFANITYur meditation, would be foolishly pagan
i'm ancient as 'amen', see i stay grym
throwin fools in in a pit full of pit bulls to be shaken
or strapped to the crossroads of PROFANITY and inner sin
which trap the sinners in, to sell such in sing-sing
i bring grym tidings, tidal-ed/titled your wave all not exciting
stop riding the PROFANITY, start writin your own PROFANITY
cause i stick figures that think they fat and can't rap wind blast
i make em slim fast, lookin like stick figures
i'm all that, i bag chips at concerts and shows
get more PROFANITY than PROFANITYs that boost victoria secret clothes
foes is tagged like ex-foes toes at the coroner's
kids with cold feet rise and fall like the barometer
grym will mentally chop your career
see PROFANITY is locked down here, like penitentiary blocks in tears
escape outta your ducts every time you hear my name
you better duck fate, or catch a PROFANITY face full of duct tape
you get smacked like a trick that sniffed off her money
then smoked like rzarector with the blunts dipped in PROFANITYney

[verse 2: prince rakeem/rzarector]
rotate your head like a gyro, my hair grows in knotty spirals
feet resembles christ's description from the bible
water-walker, immune to all physical torture
pull out fast in a porsche, upon a double-crosser
my PROFANITY rise up in the morning like a phoenix
and blast iron cells into a low blooded 'nemic
the imperial - material's venerial
mc's get PROFANITYed in serial, you can't PROFANITY with the material
unorthodox paradox, my PROFANITY is seen wide-screen magnavox
grabs thought like doctor octopus
cause war like the grandson of kush
i'm hangin devil's heads on a evergreen bush
sugar-frosted sorceresses PROFANITY get exhausted
pussy lips be drippin, like leaky faucets
undercover c-cyphers sprayed up like windshield wipers
while i'm guzzlin piper's, changin my son's PROFANITY-ass diapers
dime piece trapped in sync like many time piece
you get stampeded by the wildabeast
a rap dast' plus tracks black like chow yun fat
oppositional forces get their eardrums flat
common denominator, i swing the mic saber like vader
he was fooled by the inter-pre-atation made from a traitor
mc's get their wigs blown, trounced off my fistbone
choked from my death, every time they break a wishbone
eventually, i knew the whole world would mention me
potentially, i have the key to make g's
mc's breeze on my tracks, i rock the fruit with the trees
killa bees spread rapid like diseases
see it's, like the second comin of jesus, of nazareth
be fabulous, raise the dead crowd up like lazarus
hazardous vocabulary attacks be beautiful
acoustical notes we provoke, it comes out musically dope
niggaz realize they just can't cope
the hair, bustin out the head resembles fire and smoke loc

[verse 3: frukwan/gatekeeper]
i blast watts in circuits like general monk-monk was turkish
my science is PROFANITYided deep into your central nervous
pervert area codes PROFANITYp this PROFANITY
i'm boxed-in, PROFANITYin PROFANITYlogram PROFANITY, inhalin oxygen
parallel world of crab PROFANITY and sea shells mix
i pierce my PROFANITY and sword right through you pelvics
i'm PROFANITY stricken bomb, wrapped in trees of palm
physical existence is descendants of allah
i travel at high rates, weaker men are primates
that either migrate or get burnt to the stake
i feed off lyrical light beams of amphetimene
my terminology is panatomic like lobotomy
crazy el loco, gas PROFANITY like sunoco
flush em like presto, blast in your chest bone
i raise from the shore, like PROFANITY and gomorrah
with traction, flashin a 4-wheel drive ford explorer
while mucus lies within the center of the rubik's
the roots of the wine induced the enzymes inside your nucleus
turmoil boilin appointed, PROFANITY rubbin off my style like a ointment
lost in the sahara, from trial and error
confused with 3 meals for sister sara
rahh! bearer, digestin minerals in abundance
because the dead is not known to return from the dungeons
[junior reid]
run'din from fires of the city, and tee bloood

[masta PROFANITYa]
i was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
rugged with my timberland boots that paid
i walk with a slight lean from the way that my heat
givin a green the shine infra-red beam
at the stret traffic light recorders
takin pictures of our corners
cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
the chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
we movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
with plastic phasers in rubber hands
fuck fame, i shoot a PROFANITYle in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
how dare you call the PROFANITYs in vein!
not knowin the seriousness of this and why i came
to earth, feet first
i dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
no questionin to the session, i walk with gun
the magnum of bust-es head for many directions unknown
another statistic, change the bolistics
on the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
scrape the craters of the brain for data
old scriptures on withered paper
beginnin take shape and form
when the PROFANITYs get on it and crash your college dorm

[junior reid]
you two ta both from uptown, ah your both from downtown
your ta both from an-ah-town, ah yah both from 'roundtowm
one bloood, one blooood, one blooooood

that's blooood yuud, blooood

[masta PROFANITYa]
now verse 2, even more deadly than the first, unrehearsed raw footage
part 2 for you, i give this dedication, project elimination
he's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
i'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
here's jewels to live by
identify before you enter and can't leave with PROFANITY
fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
a PROFANITY only has one time to explode
when i break i'm takin everything, 
turn the city streets to dusty rhodes
behold this return of the invincible tone
rude like governor tuse and king toustume, 
who gave the order to bust 'em?
don't ask this is genuine draft
blueprint ultimate legit sting international, stone love classical
comin back, to attack in black fatigue
wu-tang and junior reid

[junior reid]

[intro - rza:]
feelings. the emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. a response or tendency to respond. a belief, which can be PROFANITYue, illogical, but emotionally irrational

[verse 1 - masta PROFANITYa:]
i never gave a PROFANITY on PROFANITYw the next PROFANITY felt
i rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way i felt
still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
no other emcee could get with me, is way i felt
don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
the first time you heard "protect ya neck", the way you felt
like no other hip PROFANITYp record ever made you felt
cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter PROFANITYw i felt

[verse 2 - cappadonna:]
every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
worldwide, live, polaroid PROFANITY, all my PROFANITYmies is
and we ride out to all of our music is
yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth because we know PROFANITYw it felt
give em knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
so each and every person to recognize what they felt
watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
you never know, PROFANITYw when i first came out, how my brothers felt
i've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
we would last for a night, but a better tomorrow

[verse 3 - ghostface PROFANITYah:]
i felt the angel of death breathe
when i felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
i felt like it was the end of a dynasty
like i was fighting a clique of five chinese thieves
karate slippers with slip on's so i kept slippin'
the floor was too smooth felt like i couldn't catch a grip in
felt like dragonfly jones, was dragonfly tone
so i kept spitting, woke up when i heard the phone

[verse 4 - PROFANITYod man:]
i never gave a what on PROFANITYw the next rapper felt
i take that rapper's belt myself, i feel PROFANITYw cappa felt
i don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
marker, walk on water, i see PROFANITYw jesus felt
no rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
this about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
these boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me PROFANITYw cheating felt
i'm not a failure, i couldn't tell ya PROFANITYw losing felt
might not have nailed her, but i can tell ya PROFANITYw spooning felt
remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
i burned the track with a PROFANITY rap and i know it's felt

[hook]
[casual]
it go; gangsta-gangsta, PROFANITY, PROFANITYa
i'm the black panther that shot the drug dealer
i live on the block, where dudes bust they knocks
ride on top of the car, they crush they rocks
niggaz PROFANITYt in my fifths, to run from cops
see i'm a PROFANITY too, so i know PROFANITYw PROFANITY do
keep it real, you should let that PROFANITY silence
you only been involved in domestic violence
nigga, i chase rentals with long islands
catch us in the club, doing them long, wiling
the microphone marvelous, this marvin haggler
it's so obvious, in the lobby, suave and dressed
where the party is? round trip, flight to laguardia
nobody dodge, when we walk through the audience
dolo, with more dough to blow though
for sure though, slide one deep in a four door
i'm poor though, catch me rocking a lisa lobo
bump yo PROFANITY, i want more to the boatload

[tragedy khadafi]
your coat can't save your soul, but i'm foe
it's written in gold, hieroglyphic egyptian scroll
streets i've been in, from the beginning i'm a legend
never flee up from my enemies, shots i'm sending
musical martyr like john lennon, from the beginning
spit with a vengeance, semi-automatic weapon repping
calm stop, warlock like david geffen
blowin' ox', like oxygen, out of my nostrils
seen brave men, fight for they PROFANITYnor and even die
two gorgeous PROFANITYas, blowing the heaters down the ride
to the, end of the earth, through PROFANITY, water and fire
queens messiah, camouflage black attire
magnum opus, top five, dead or alive
the feds focus my militants, swervin' the lotus
mossberg in the PROFANITYstess, i write it then release it
then i, bless the street, giving birth to soldiers
rolls gold, king tut piece, flooded with boulders
i praise allah, make this a lot, facing the east
this is for them black and white babies, starving to eat, think differently

[rock marciano]
poverty stricken, fried chicken, fly rhyme kicking
blind visions from the mind's wisdom, in this crime religion
niggaz listen, what i'm spitting is hard as prison
benches in the trenches, grym intentions, twin doberman pinchers
leather trenches, lead drenches for brat endless
gats eleven inches, ya neck slit it, your head spin it
the epidemic was spread infinite, so once the thread is knitted
for seven digits, it's just business, no disrespect intended
to he who feel offended, a beat down cannot be prevented
big hit it, the game i'm deep in it, until my yankee fitted
switch three, be hanging PROFANITY, squeeze three eighty triggers
used to PROFANITY my babysitters, now i whip mercedes-benz'
i stand alone, cause i'm grown, for me to crush the walkman
gang lover supporter, of any sort, when i'm new york
rollin' for dolo, the willie bobo gotta go bro
word to jomo, the kid in the polo, got the world in a yo-yo
your happy meal skills is still, no frills
cook ckrills, sign deals, when you see me, just kneel
or rocking mills, your PROFANITYspital bill
blood from your nostril spill, it's not looking well
when i lick off shots, the PROFANITYstages yell
chopper fell like ox tail, your optic's swell

[vordul mega]
ninjas with blades, raised from jungles of wolves
in PROFANITYods, where hammers bark and the tennis spark
police on radar, so we stay fogged up
puffin' blunts, sippin' goose, and damage
god PROFANITY it's hard, but still, we gettin' by like rhino's
ones that PROFANITYl, crucified on the earth, for guns and needles
nine inches, hurt, i cause stitches, build
with PROFANITYs on track, suffering visible scars, it's hard to relax
ready to spaz, no PROFANITY, thirst for cash, times moving fast
we like cheaters with masks, lighting cheeba and hash
tryin' to balance the steps, screaming, we need freedom
tired of bleeding, where ego's let out of evil
town is of death, no time for weakness
higher heights to reach, advance the concrete
with iron feet...
[intro: PROFANITYical]
yo son i know what time it is

(read the rims)

[prodical:]
'87, drug, never change their game

plaque for the cheddar, shots out the face of the beretta
through the corner store that lady and kid, they caught it raw
smokin' leaf poor, make me wanna PROFANITY that PROFANITY's jaw
eatin' with the poor, tryin' to live life for what it's for
twelve years later, caught me on tour two on da road
two on the track, two with the plaques, two with the gats
iced out cats, better think twice before you rap
up in your PROFANITY back, only a snitch get that
fuck the chit-chat, click-click-clack, through your adam's app'
brook-nam grace and charm, remain calm
in these big streets we struggle just to make ends meet
pigs with heat, livin' out the devil's deceit
see i'm a rebel plus my level's complete
bitches say i'm sort of unique
you can catch me as a PROFANITY sheets
solid steel meet, i keep it real with the 'nique

[shyheim:]
fuck a fair fight, come out my corner with a knife
y'all big elephant PROFANITY beware of us little mice
you know that we like that cheddar, to make our life better

[chorus: 12 o'clock]
shit is crazy real in the field

and major drug deals on the real
watch a PROFANITY get mils, and his PROFANITY get him PROFANITYed

[12 o'clock:]
yo, p let's get this dough quick, PROFANITY on the wrist
platinum bracelets, see his range's the whip
summer time, comin' quick you got eighty-five percent
nigga talk that slick and get his brain blown to bits
throw you in pits and PROFANITY lock like pits
got my whole PROFANITY click, PROFANITY, handlin' fifths
they blastin' and PROFANITY, i'm after that kid
who rock that glass benz, PROFANITY throw it in his wig
kidnap his kid, throw his brain in the fridge
slappy and pig, PROFANITY, place where i live

and let his daughter drop a fridge on his
move like the wind to brooklyn bridge, straight to my crib

[chorus x3]

[outro: 12 o'clock]

[intro:]
wu-tang
holocaust punishment
yo, yo, yo, yo
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[verse 1:]
from the hills of the pacific
i bring fury and anger
stabbing devils in their chest with a rusty ship anchor
blood and sand we command and conquer
wasted land,
then expand the regions undiscovered by modern man
body counts increase by thousands by the PROFANITYur
the PROFANITY on reserve blastin PROFANITYts from the water tower
absorbin' energy from the sun mc's run
my brain burst like to blow chunks outta you lungs
blood on the pavement
crews gaze in amazement
i was doing that to PROFANITY who test me on the PROFANITY ship
we sell tapes and stage jail breaks for past cell mates
murder you at PROFANITY's gate daring PROFANITY to yell PROFANITY
and pale face gests PROFANITYllow points i swallow joints
with romantic charisma that'll make your momma moist
my voice ensemble of bullets rip through your squadron
circulate the planets move back you better dodge 'em
or get opened up like a margin
buddah sargeant,
christ i should've warned you i never missed a target
the living weapon war machine by buried king
relentless remorse is guiltless and unclean
also the sources supreme of my team
black knight brigade PROFANITYls caps like tangerine
holocaustic, hypnotic, PROFANITYtic, sub-atomic,
psychopathic, hyperactive, unattractive

[chorus:]
we bring nothing but punishment
like nice be runnin' PROFANITY
have 'em runnin' quick
uppercuts is what we coming with
fuck the government
i grab the mic, that's when the thunder hit
never love a PROFANITY
rhymes echo throughout the dungeon pits
[repeat]

[verse 2:]
something from my culture
i stay to harmony
the way of life that best suits me
i sincerely love allah's mathematics
freedom and raw the abbott
i rest within the square
which is 4 times 90 why PROFANITY trues dare
the dominant intelligence
99 elements we're offspring celibate
without knowledge life's irrelevant
i wrote the benevolent (wu-tang eminent)

[verse 3:]
i bring lyrics to existence
when i speak these powerful words
the priest of pandimonium the wargod has emerged
above sea-level that's when thunder rolls
and lightning strike down
atrocity lay that poor PROFANITY and rain it for you compund
chaotically the black knights we move PROFANITYally
lyrically perform labotamy on your biology a PROFANITYigy
a philosophy and theology my idiology's to break down
mc's microscopically
the ghetto tropically gettin' more hectic by the second
ghetto warfare straight bullets hit off the window sectors
and hit kids cause PROFANITY spit wigs with no precautions
the war i raise down from their grave to haunt your concious
with PROFANITY screams nightmares and bloody dreams
of PROFANITY haunting you through dark alleyways
through missing smoke screen
have you tweaking like a PROFANITY fiend
on high bean like christine
the lords rain supreme

[chrous]

[verse 4:]
i'm original mallot
with metaphor dominant intelligence
i give a PROFANITY a PROFANITY detention with his
birthstar invention
i was mentioned i be creeping with the intention
to break free from this evil mad society
don't lie to me
i'm dope, i scope stuff i like to telescope
to provoke from being choked
cause my ability is soul lying
and let me open up your insides
and man hide,
not from confusion with this high energy i'm using
static got you lighting and moving
through the abyss where snakes hiss
and many men get PROFANITY for following false elements
for following false elements

[chorus: last line x2]
[kung fu sample]
if only we can lay our hands on that PROFANITY yu shin hua
then all our problems will be over...
yu shin hua!
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

[rza]
the quintessence, father of the hip PROFANITYp renaissance
my slang been around before baton and benetton
i've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
so when i squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
c-cypher pigs can't identify it
the true and living PROFANITY, son, we exemplify it
the most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it
bzzz, don't knock it til you try it
flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then i take a swagger
ice cold jã¤germeister, take a dragon PROFANITYld
bo county crook, slide like the nike swoosh
bruce almighty got more problems than spidey, look
old brooklyn, putnam avenue crook, i've been tooken
all around the world, rooked it then, drive back in brooklyn
good looking, son, yo, son, bring the PROFANITYok in
you can never find zig weak spot, stop looking

[kung fu sample]
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

[raekwon]
from the continents to croatia, i'll flame a lamester
with the new slang, much more to show ya
these rocks change, glock fully, PROFANITYt pellets
have me running through the hall, it's on, like you being chased by the relic
can't nothing harm me, yo, i move through any project
with logic, few semi's, hide in the PROFANITYpit
scream out, shallah and i'mma tap in, harder than tinactin
don't try to play the fella, i'll blacked in
moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
black man, black PROFANITYoded, moving through the city
like you batman, still you so PROFANITY, like catwoman
don't bother the legion, more squeezing, more reason
to light a new block up, cause me to cement PROFANITY
powerful block shoppers and all PROFANITY getting that gwop
dare you to try to find my weak spot

[kung fu sample]
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

[gza]
i stay on the 64 squares, while patrolling the center
trading PROFANITYe from material, the time zone, i enter
it's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
advancements and development, once the PROFANITY reaches
to 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
my opponent's base is threatend, soldiers cut with shanks
moved all my small pieces, mc's are driven back
unable to avoid capture from the attack
such movement, is naturally quite unsound
men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
before the double rooks had approached it
they must of been quick to ignore the principles
rock a v and an effective PROFANITY is invincible
a strategic plan, just the way i envisioned it
many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment

[kung fu sample]
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

[outro: ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY]
i tell you, right, right, right, in ya PROFANITYfuckin' face
muthafucka, you know, well, you know PROFANITYfuckin' well
when -- we don't play that PROFANITY, or, i don't play that shit
that's just wu-tang, you know, i'm the PROFANITY
that -- that, give it to ya raw
when i said "first thing first, man, you PROFANITY with the worst
i be sticking pins ya head, like a PROFANITY nurse
i'll attack any PROFANITY who slack in his mack
come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
shame on you, when you step through to
the ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY straight from the brooklyn zu"
[hook x2:]
if a miracle, could save us from
the travesty, that we've become
if a million sons would stand as one
we will overcome, overcome

[verse 1 - inspectah deck:]
the whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
the other day i had to bury my PROFANITYmegirl
wrong place, caught one in her face
plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
for heaven's sake, you pray PROFANITY open the gate
in this modern day PROFANITY, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a g pack, he chose the whole 8
catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
and the police informer was your childhood friend
in the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
for the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
he's the young capone, he grew up in a drug PROFANITYme
stranded on the ave with a blunt and his gun shown

[hook]

[verse 2 - masta PROFANITYa:]
alive, seen things from the PROFANITYfather saga
a martin scorsese classic and i'm the author
drama at the opera, crime story novel
tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
meeting place scheduled at the broadway musical
bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
shotgun, the underboss of our main source
of interest, the black widow PROFANITY empress
a princess rich from her family's inheritance
now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
that was missin' in the last shipment
at first, everything nice, everything routine
jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
but on this day he wasn't ready and my PROFANITY sense keen
i noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
it wasn't steady when he squeezed

[hook]

[verse 3 - raekwon:]
he went from prince to a king out of a life of PROFANITY
wearin' tailor-made suits, sky dwellers and clusters
to perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
that pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
you're my right hand, PROFANITY, he PROFANITY the trust up
it's ruined, PROFANITY caught him slidin' on his belly
i'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
contemplatin' PROFANITY now, i'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
but it's my man at the same time, i don't wanna do him
he violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
it's over, in the falls of niagara, he was soakin'
with a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'

[hook x2]

[verse 4 - ghostface PROFANITYah:]
allah let me lay in your arms
hold me like a newborn, sing to me the most sweetest song
the exalted, the most benevolent
the knower of all, keep me safe 'till i return back to your residence
this earth, my place of birth
as time went through the ages it got worse
sicknesses, beheadings in syria
ebola's PROFANITYin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
dear PROFANITY, it's been a minute since i cried out
since mama died, i never wild out
we need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
can you hear me? can you hear me now?
we need a miracle
destroy the fda for PROFANITYldin' back cures so they can get paid

underground left and right pair surround sound can't be scared
plea the ams radio tapes that he jammed
golden chrome, desert eagle never left at PROFANITYme
flip the track of the beat watch bobby flip the metronome
high voltage, keep my seed and wiz well cultured
kill enemies by mailin them the poison glue postage
i open or fold ya, PROFANITY PROFANITY a ogre
i leave the cat a book of food stamps used at krogers

adjust these boots and PROFANITY cube steaks from key food

yo, be for real
i was buried on a battlefield

i was buried on a battlefield
located near israel
the rest of my platoon
was trapped upon a hill
i heard mega...
...yo, be for real

i was buried on a battlefield
i heard megabombs, firearms, and more alarms
and hand grenades, mad rage in evil ways
my destination was to seek life
i mean the stars were so low they appeared as street lights
i was shown the crucifixion by two egyptians
there was war in heaven, i saw christ with a mac-11
so i joined his army, prepare for armaggedeon... armaggedeon...

they told me this, slowly
taking me, into, the mental
orgasms, 'jacualting, stimulating, relating
to life, incubating, rotating around light beams
from a light beam i was formed in the white dream
and then redeemed, like powder, out of, my maker
into, nature, returned, to vapor
killah, priest, was born, in a pillar, of yeast
lost in the miscarriage
the automatic, for marriage
[rza]
the PROFANITYy is a vehicle for the mind
you realize that your PROFANITYy, is basically vacumnin that PROFANITYe
into somethin from within this PROFANITYy
this is why the air must come in, every breath
look at - i say look at odb, okay
a free man for real, knahmsayin?
his his expression of freedom, his what he wanted to do
it was very free, one out of a million people
could deter him, from an idea, y'knahmean?
cause he was free to express like that, y'knahmean?
[instrumental for the first 11 seconds]

[rza]
for the supreme architecture
that's the one who come with the most illest ideas
the one who come with the illest creation
a supreme architecture is actually someone who build the universe
if i personally say i'm the supreme architecture
i'm i'm lettin allah speak right, right there knahmsayin?
i'm speakin right through that, i'm i'm becomin a vehicle

[15 seconds of instrumental]

[rza]
word it's like the truth
they say the truth shall set you free

knahmean his own equations

truth number, drop a few jewels in the booth
used to boost PROFANITYs, stuff 'em inside of a tennis ball
and throw 'em when they rushing the block, trust no cops
driving around with two mitts in my socks
cooked PROFANITY'll get you more trouble then money
don't crawl with the dust juice, the pigs is PROFANITYgry

he had a sword and an ax that cuts
under a robe that was woven from silver and gold and waxed it up
his army was so great, the quantity
his crops and life stock, boost the economy
many will travel by boat to see him
his image adorn most schools and coliseums
a merchant hustle those silk and velvets
portrait illuminated when the torch was well light
picture so beautiful painted, that
one thought agree to move, cuz it will leave a mood
or energy, you see his wife practice yoga
made herbal enhancers that have saved the soldiers
god with treasures, in the chambers, halls and votes
well prepared for all PROFANITYaults, heavy guarded village
armed with the sharpest weapons, designed to pierce

we have an apb on an mc PROFANITYer
looks like the work of a master
evidence indicates that's it's stature
merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
the flow, changes like a chameleon
plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
this technique attacks the immune system
disguised like a lie paralyzing the victim
you scream as it enters your bloodstream
erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
moving on a PROFANITY with the speed of a centipede
and injure - any PROFANITY contender

[chorus]
[intro:]

shaolin shadowboxing, and the wu-tang sword style

and as we step in the door, we cause panic
yep, the usual suspects, we at it
vexed at it, y'all went a week with the belt
few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself

[method man]
uh, y'all see i'm in the street strugglin
young dumb and PROFANITYgin, give a PROFANITY about nuttin
stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
vision my PROFANITY now get in where you fit in
and see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
ante up cause if you blow the dice
on that o-z, dorothy ain't goin PROFANITYme tonight
that's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the PROFANITY
searchin for a quick antidote
mo' money, mo' problems to cope

[gza]
we were at the same table when the chips were checked
a gamblin +rebel+ who +inspects+ the +deck+
just when you thought we would fold our hand
against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
it was live on air but in between station breaks
i was PROFANITYldin a pair and just made the table stakes
split the demos, put insurance on tapes
a safeguard against the crusaders in capes
if i double down they say the PROFANITYs are sharks
if we win against the PROFANITYuse they thought the cards was marked
we draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
while the dealer promoted the full PROFANITYuse venue
a PROFANITY in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
the high roller who got credit upon signin
they look puzzled when i shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
recourse of bluff game's your muscle

[chorus - 0.75x]
[raekwon] say what? ("shaolin shadowboxing!")
[r. isley] PROFANITY's bout to change..

[raekwon the chef]
aiyyo, on rainy days i sit back and count ways on
how to get rich, coolin with a mean ill jamaican PROFANITY
banana coat matchin with the ratchet
lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
flow through your PROFANITYod in the mean tints that's giant
it's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
buried you alive, left your PROFANITY cryin
we on your floor look more doors
dey ain't ate either, i PROFANITYpe y'all PROFANITY is armed
and when we get there, all my PROFANITY in the mix
yeah shallah lex, diamond got me buyin louis rich

[ghostface PROFANITYah]
most people say the clan was missin since i got dropped offa radio
overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
everybody switched they names like
whatcha call it, any fast (?)
it was the PROFANITYs that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned PROFANITY
clarks from digi left the game dizzy
ooh got busy, that dancey PROFANITY slid through
we had to stay PROFANITYod cause that's who we been through
rza came through, mastermind got the cash and power
proof that power plastered PROFANITYine classical lines
mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
now PROFANITY with the radical shines
it's ghost-deini, every coast need me
we back PROFANITY that's right, it's the w.t.c.
world trade center, wu-tang clan
we brought so much heat that we was givin you tears an' PROFANITY

[verse one: PROFANITYah priest]

when you're PROFANITYly frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
you both had strong minds
combined with feelings, she seems appealing
for each other, discreet lover, no longer keeps brothers
smothered under deep covers
erotic programs, moet and slow jams
enough to make you PROFANITYld hands
and plus you a bold man
you fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
and PROFANITY ego, of fly PROFANITY
whole garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
months later, he's layin on a respirator
depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
and start losing sight in his right eye
in weeks he might die

[verse two: raekwon]

yeah, uh-huh

part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs

begging forgiveness, calling that up top PROFANITY syphillis

straight off the edge, into the PROFANITY
peep my new style PROFANITY cristal and moet

"what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets

"what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

[35 seconds of instrumental pass until the martial arts samples]

one is invulnerable, in fact
it involves strenuous breath control
out of all techniques, it's the most difficult

thirty-six of these can be fatal
the remainder, paralyzing
[ghostface - whispering]
shh, shh, shh, shh, wu, wu, tang, tang

time to re-up, let these PROFANITY know we back on the block
with three PROFANITYdred off a g-pack, PROFANITY in the spot

[interlude]

[chorus]
[ol PROFANITY PROFANITY:]
what y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
i'm the osiris of this PROFANITY
wu-tang is here forever PROFANITY
this like this ninety-seven
aight my PROFANITY and my PROFANITYrettes
let's do it like this
i'mma rub your PROFANITY in the moonshine
let's take it back to seventy-nine

[inspectah deck:]
i bomb atomically socrates' philosophies
and hypothesis can't define PROFANITYw i be dropping these
mockeries lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me
battle-scarred shogun explosion when my pen hits
tremendous ultra-violet shine blind forensics
i inspect you through the future see millennium
killa beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets queen beez ease the guns in
rumble with patrolmen tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor die-hard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow swinging swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked performing live on your PROFANITYttest block

[method man:]
as the world turns i spread like germ
bless the globe with the pestilence the hard-headed never learn
this my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
transform into the ghost rider a six-pack
and a streetcar named desire who got my back?
in the line of fire PROFANITYlding back what?
my peoples if you with me where the PROFANITY at?
niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
it's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad PROFANITY
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm what the blood
clot we smoke PROFANITY and blow spots
you wanna think twice i think not
the iron lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
guns of navarone tearing up your battle zone
rip through your slums

[cappadonna:]
i twist darts from the heart tried and true
loop my voice on the lp martini on the slang rocks
certified chatterbox vocabulary 'donna talking
tell your story walking
take cover kid what? run for your brother kid
run for your team and your six camp rhyme groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
my deadly notes reign supreme
your fort is basic compared to mine
domino effect arts and crafts
paragraphs contain cyanide
take a free ride on my dart i got the fashion
catalogues for all y'all to all praise to the PROFANITY

[ol PROFANITY PROFANITY:]
the saga continues
wu-tang wu-tang

[u-god:]
olympic torch flaming we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory the agony defeat
we crush slow flaming deluxe slow
for judgment day cometh conquer it's war
allow us to escape PROFANITY globe spinning bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tunes spit the PROFANITY mortal kombat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle PROFANITY vigilante tantrum
a death kiss catwalk squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom tranquilized with anesthetics
my orchestra graceful music ballerinas
my music sicily rich california smell
an axe PROFANITY adventure paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing-sing sipping on ginseng
righteous wax chaperon rotating ring kings

[rza:]
maech or the wooden soldiers c-cypher-punks couldn't PROFANITYld us
a thousand men rushing in not one PROFANITY was sober
perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like flair
escape from your dragon's lair in particular
my beats travel like a vortex through your spine
to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw PROFANITY
enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
heart terminal like grand central station
program fat basslines on novation
getting PROFANITY like a PROFANITY i'm ducking five-year probation

[gza:]
war of the masses the outcome disastrous
many of the victim families save their ashes
a million names on walls engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for their acts
another heart is torn as close ones mourn
those who stray PROFANITY get slayed on the song

[masta PROFANITYa:]
the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
ninety-three million miles away from came one
to represent the nation this is a gathering
of the masses that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle the crowd now screams in rage
the high chief jamel irief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save self from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

[ghostface PROFANITYah:]
yo! yo! yo PROFANITY that look at all these crab PROFANITY laid back
lamping like them gray and black puma's on my man's rack
codeine was forced in your drink
you had a navy green salamander fiend
bitches overheard you scream
you two-faces PROFANITY of the slum i got your whole PROFANITYy numb
blowing like shalamar in eighty-one
sound convincing thousand dollar cork-pop convention
hands like sonny liston get fly permission
hold the PROFANITY up i'll unfasten your wig bad luck
i humiliate separate the english from the dutch
it's me black PROFANITYle drew ali
came in threes we like the genovese
sazon season these degrees
it's earth ninety-three million miles from the first
rough turbulence the wave burst split the megahertz

[raekwon:]
aiyo that's amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk
connect dots to make my man child walk
swift notarizer blue-tang all up in the high-riser
new york yank' visor world tranquilizer
just a dosage delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean see y'all the number one draft pick
tear down the beat PROFANITY then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor flex the white-gold tarantula
track truck diesel play the PROFANITY PROFANITY substantiala
max mostly undivided then slide in sickening
guaranteed made 'em jump like rod strickland
[u-god]
countdown...
are you ready? are you mad inside?
got you strapped down to your seats
outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
god speed, approach follow my lead
firewinds gust, empire crush
full PROFANITY, fall in the PROFANITYle, roll wit the rush
untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
soundwaves slay out the back, ?cave? smoke
my belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
down PROFANITY, elegant as fantasia
killer whale tale inhale, black male from asia
all out the wood works, PROFANITYod shirts and wizards
no match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
in the shaft, shotty cop, hip PROFANITYp to the limit
nightwatch, pad mark
sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
gimmie what it takes now!!

[chorus x2: u-god]
rage rock roll fight
brawl fall PROFANITYblllllleee!!!

[letha face]
the diabolic witty, dialect's darker than gotham city
wit the possibilty to stop your walkin ability
god forgive me, spark enemies wit pistol grips
the missle tip's impact hit you so hard, you PROFANITY through your PROFANITY
official scripts strikes when physical hits
you physical PROFANITY, watch for the imperial blitz, serious PROFANITY
submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
liver than wwf warzone
walk upon ? tracks, PROFANITYies collapse
rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when PROFANITYtery PROFANITYs
logical facts from the terror dome
spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
in PROFANITY you now entrust
dog you like PROFANITYund and mutts, pound pups get sound struck
clown what? you'll get drowned in the cut
while crowd round up

[chorus x2]

[inspectah deck]
aiyyo yo

travellin tremendous speed measurin far
been bustin satellites circlin mars
verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
of a PROFANITYdred wild PROFANITY piled in a trojan PROFANITYrse
thought PROFANITYod, set it on generic mic ethic
professional neck PROFANITY, left foes beheaded
this music, is mind control like computer chips
been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
wit turbo tactics, manuever like a trained soldier
hall of fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
ayatollah, high roller nine totter
mind controller, 2009 time folder
my coalition, bring the demolition
wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
spittin hazardous darts, up front like rosa parks
makin million men march

[chorus x2]

[method man]
yo, who got next? PROFANITY got next
i chin check, all these mc's line em up PROFANITY, i go ? hard
declare PROFANITYly war, it be hard to dip and dodge
police squads tryin to bogard, we rip and rob
the boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's PROFANITYw it is
in the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
so goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
rusty-ass .38 special, PROFANITY owe me
slowly i turn, face the one and only
naughty by nature, i do my dirt all by my lonely
ask pretty tony, when i got a PROFANITY i keeps a bitch
36 chambers, enter at your own risk
take that watch off and tuck your necklace
city never sleeps, streets is restless
rap style'll PROFANITY you, when you least expect it
pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
wu-tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
i deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

puffin' on the finest cheeba, green as a rainforest
doin' a buck on i-95, screamin', "i live for this"
they just seen us comin', blew a flat
pulled over to the shoulder
pop the trunk to see if it's a spare in the back
a van pulled up, with florida tags
three men jumped out with guns drawn and they all wore masks
snatched me up and handcuffed me
hit me with the PROFANITY of the gun
i'm thinkin' to myself, "the war just begun"
thirty minutes in the ride, the mask came off
the chickens dropped, the two in the back had russian accents
askin' who my connect is, where he rest PROFANITY

he said, "nah, you're worth more to us alive than dead"
he's flashed his badge and started laughin'
"cocksucker, we the feds"

'cause kelly got popped from her man

power moves all up in my building selling PROFANITY
and kids around my way they just don't know PROFANITYw to act
like my little man stole drugs got some kids fed
and ted found him dead with a bullet to his head
baby brother to my man van

and what's his name dies from aids
mom dukes outta commission from breaking bothe her legs

[chorus:]

lord PROFANITY ain't wid all the PROFANITY we was down for
i'm still struggling bubbling for paper
the herds like back in the day to pull a caper
the takers, now i got a plan to expand
put it short import export to foreign lands
stand forever like birds of a feather
together whatever if PROFANITY flip that's clever
the weather change but the style still remains the same
who's to blame with the neighbourhood fame
i knew the game since the days that i played as a shorty

[chrous:]
another bronx war story
sometimes i have to search for information to find out
why we was put in these certain situations
the inner city life controlled by the outer world g

peep this, i closed down the kith store for thousand dollar sneakers
bought a dozen pair with 'em, shared 'em with his cousin
wu-tang slang boomerang back like reggie hudlin
from new york city to philly to los angeles
the wu-tang slang is mad dangerous
you can't outthink the rza, PROFANITY, i'll make your brain shrink
my lyrics are vitamins, i go from a to zinc
and yeah, i got that iron just in case the emcee think
he can take it to the streets, then watch his PROFANITY become extinct
like a tyrannosaurus rex
i turn your PROFANITY' face to jonah hex

[ghostface PROFANITYah:]
ayy, yo, last night my sugar was five PROFANITYdred

branded by the steel iron, bullets flying
ladies being hit through wickedness, i'm losing my grip
i thought we lived by the books, the bible, koran
we pick cotton, my back is still PROFANITYt and dark and
they threw burners in our babies' faces
pale hands that looked scary touched our PROFANITYies in the strangest places
sweat from the white man's head
fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head, almighty
alrighty, PROFANITY is PROFANITY
god won't you tell me why these PROFANITY PROFANITY is PROFANITY?

how dare you try to deny allah's intelligence?
kidnap the truth, and destroying the black evidence

[verse 1 - inspectah deck:]
they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
before you hear that i decided to tell, i'd rather die in a cell
i was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
scorin' money like the meter on the yellow cab
give the witness an unexpected visit
make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
like, "i was on the ground, i ain't see him bustin'"
now the da chasin' a plea, they hatin' i'm free
the case is mistaken identity

[verse 2 - PROFANITYod man:]
whoever push me like pusha t, i push back
i push a cap, before '93, i pushed PROFANITY
i'm PROFANITYod, black, you know me well, what's good scrap?
i'm smokin' rappers, you are a l, what's good smack?
hold up that's goods rap, pardon self
i just like good rap, but when i see goods i give his goods back
i rap for riders that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
to 25 to lifers that jack mac
we movin' ratchets, no kat stacks, it's magic
the way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
i'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
when life take a PROFANITY in your bed, you flip the mattress
before you try and get my head, get you some pampers
then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
kick in my vicinity, i'm what rappers pretend to be
charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity

[hook x2 - streetlife:]
mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
check my id, wu-tang, that's the legacy

[verse 3 - u-god:]
fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
two suitcases, dangle on his hands
he opened up the door, headed up the stairs
thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
first sight he saw, struck him by surprise
two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
windows blown out, no prints on the door
all he seen was blood stains, smear the PROFANITY floor
911, ambulance showed up
blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
but he was bangin' mrs. prixy at the motor lodge
he got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
the PROFANITY fit the judge, he might take the fall
someone set him up, a botched robbery
mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be

[verse 4 - cappadonna:]
17 years old, i'm headed back to the PROFANITYle
mistaken identity, every way was sold
i look like a PROFANITYodlum, i rock a lot of gold
they lockin' everybody up, ship your PROFANITY up the road
i ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
tried to set me up, plantin' PROFANITY in my pocket
the beast pat me up, they won't let me off

[verse 5 - masta PROFANITYa:]
na-n-n-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
it could never been the g-o-d, not me
you terribly mistaken, son, i ain't the one
we could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
what resemblance does he strike? so my mic fahrenheit
w for my a-alike, your dna match tight
even if they bite us, close but not quite
they still tryna get it right, mistaken identity

from metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
wicked PROFANITY come, try to burglarize the turf
scattin off soft-ass beats them PROFANITY rap happily
tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
you couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
where i come from, gettin visual is habitual
de-mon-strate walkin on PROFANITYt coal, in rituals
i splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
he took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
just consider the unparallel advantage
of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

[verse two: ol PROFANITY PROFANITY/osirus]

ginseng boost, i got yo' neck in a noose
keep my money wrinkled, the rap star PROFANITYle PROFANITYer instinct

i play for keeps in the streets
cos its real on the battlefield
shells hit the ground from the steel
bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
words combine when i rhyme to feed the blind
prepare my queen for battle and walk down
i drink from the wine of violence, no tolerance
game word bond, sword silenced

buy enough ammunition,go round and sweep the streets
of brooklyn, central, sugar-whipped the rental

[inspectah deck:]
deuce high when i start my game
it's like [?] y'all, all you see is sparks and flames
i grab bags and i park my ways, the way i have 'em all locked
you would think they gave they heart to [?]
bet on us, baby, ain't no better odds to play
it's hard to fake, my real life is on display
either love or hate whatever part you play
i take the best of both worlds like r. and jay
own boss, no third party
produce more PROFANITY than irv gotti
like i'm working on my third PROFANITYy
deck, PROFANITY it quick
24/7 bed rest, that's PROFANITYw ill it get
can't stop if i mash the brakes
got the cash it takes, i might flash my face
[?] got me floating like i'm trapped in PROFANITYe
not safe for your workplace, a basket case

[masta PROFANITYa:]
don't stop, never stop
can't stop getting this guap
fat money not, hammer PROFANITY, curry PROFANITYt
cuck a fool, hit the block
no shorts, bring it back
flipping this, stack that
free it up, weight it up
don't stop, never stop
can't stop getting this guap
fat money not, hammer PROFANITY, curry PROFANITYt
cuck a fool, hit the block
no shorts, bring it back
flipping this, stack that
free it up, weight it up
quest to success with my mind on my money
came a new rhyme saying "wu-tang is the best"
music
[kung fu sample]
now, it's the master's turn though
i'm betting in, well there's a show here

[intro: rza]
watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
watch your step, kid, watch your step
watch your step, kid, watch your step..
yo, yo, yo

[rza]
we take your wizzes away, like we be called on
deep in PROFANITYe like the millennium falcon
ya'll be fools, scored like ancient babylon
rabbits and turtles, all run the marathon
yup, ya'll paper chasing, ya'll human racing
who got the best basement?
you got a 6sl, i got a ssl
i score movies, make supreme clientele

[chorus: thea van seijen (rza)]
oh, here i am (my wu-tang slang is that new york city PROFANITY)
no, can't get it near, i quit (my wu-tang slang is that new york city PROFANITY)
all day, all night, what brings to you life
for you in the world (my wu-tang slang is that new york city PROFANITY)

[rza]
silly rabbits, trynna disrespect the abbott
don't you know that we'll turn your cold PROFANITYy to maggots
i got forty million records sold, some platinum, some gold
some we just put out to meet the tax code
your career will be shorter than the 21st of december
be one of those thousand rappers no one remembers
while my name is carved on trophies, colleges recite my bars
you can look up, and see my name up on the stars
and when it comes down to that basic talent
i got 20 little cousins that can meet your challenge
yo, stop and listen, and check this proposition
son, got lots of vision, plus lots of wisdom
hindsight, foresight, insight, out of sight
some try to imitate, but they are not alike
they only piggy back, have a digi snack
that wu-tang slang is that new york city PROFANITY

[chorus]

[kung fu sample]
we're just dealing, of a man
tough take before you
a cryptic to your power
the reason why we slept and spared your son's life
was to give you faith
thank you, man, thank you
you fight well, the hand must reach to the sky
save the best for me, and have perfect breathing
good breath control, you know of these

[chorus]
look, vibe with me
rhyme is tricky, who ridin' with me
who kinda miss me can kinda miss me, you kinda iffy
don't know the history? i'm from the city of stop and frisk me
the cops is jiggy, they spot the blickey then try and get me
my pops a willie, said "give her fifty, she pop her kitty"
he bad boy and he poppa really, it's not a biggie
see my committee, block offici', it's not an ishy
or i'm too lazy to cross roads, if not, i'm busy
it's not a mystery who shot ricky, but where the difference
between the trã© and the dough, boy, we bred different
so bear witness, this can leave you with head missing
if y'all can hear me, i guarantee you the feds listening
so i be spittin' in barcode, nothin' left in the tap, dog
and after the last call, the bar close
they spark cohiba, cigar blow
even tony stark knows the tension is thick as wallabee clark soles
but did i mention i'm sick and gotta be PROFANITY
hard-boiled, taking your base, that's what we ball for
money over PROFANITY, that's what the mob for
rappers stuck in limbo 'cause they were settin' the bar low
every time i rhyme on a track, it's like a combo
king, we put the nine to your back, it's like you rondo
when it come to john, though, i'ma slaughter a john doe
drag him through a drive-thru like he ordered the combo
hands on him, we wild style with the cans on him
then come defeat, that's my beliefs and i stand on 'em
give you the beats, no doc dre or brands on 'em
some band want 'em, these verses PROFANITYt and the fans want 'em
i'm from the school of them hard knocks with harder standards
i've been a hard rock before they added the arm & hammers
i'm at the nana's, bogus PROFANITYod, we call it bama
gun on the camera so we can shoot them in panoramas
na-nana-nana, i'm feelin' petty but watch your manners
use proper grammar so we could stop with the propaganda
no type of slander but tell them PROFANITYs 'i'm not your santa'
just want the PROFANITYy, PROFANITYody tryin' to PROFANITY-and-pan ya
cop scanners, a fuller PROFANITYuse but we not the tanners
if shooters bringin' them hawks out, then it's not atlanta's

if time is money, i got time and time saved
i pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
nobody get 'til i got mine, my mind made
if time is money, i got time and time saved
i pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
nobody get 'til i got mine, my mind made
[x2]
"don't pursue him.
it would be dangerous.
because that might force him to PROFANITY you.
and he would not hesitate to do that."

"i have two serious female disciples.

my husband died. he was PROFANITYed some time ago
in a battle with the wu-tang."

high PROFANITYency top, smoke a bag of black
and feel the vibe, wanna be wise 
we, form on a rising corner mean five
laws in disguise, throw on your slides
young PROFANITY racist, smokers is basic
we seen the eyes, laying up playing the cut
what, stay in the truck, something told me duck
folding me up, my shoulders struck
out of luck, PROFANITY the PROFANITYters up
fell on a daze like a golotta PROFANITY
niggas tried to PROFANITYy me up
i'm in the lobby bleeding
niggas in the witness office probably eating
and sprinting and beefing, when they heard the shots
called the precinct and seen barber nieces beasting
niggas shot shalar features and shocked her was a elisis, 
bent the spinal cordless creatures
i'm gagging and flagging a cab down
guess who in the benz wagon, dragging my sound down
macking it was dale breedy the greedy
caniving PROFANITY snake genie
cop with a bikini will PROFANITY charge and benini
i'm feeling wheezy and the drain from the cheeba
grieving ain't even looking decent
seeing police PROFANITY reaching

that splash against my PROFANITYllow bones
that rocks my...

[inspectah deck]
fleeing the crime scene speeding
beefing leaving behind cream
not even PROFANITYping that i was leaking
won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
still jakes are creeping
don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend
keep the ruger PROFANITYling who's squealing
few knew the dealings
keep the steel concealed in
cause we got no time for feelings
eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
million dollar block villain plotting on a PROFANITYing
feel like, a superhero talking like a true deniro
they boost his ego path and broke down
reduced to zero
cops feel we poors PROFANITYping i'll reveal my source, source

that splash against my PROFANITYllow bones
that rocks my soul
oh oh, oh oh

[ghostface]
outside the check cashing, flashing
dipped in fashion
five cherry-faced PROFANITY tried to cash in
they keep laughing, ghost you get ya face bashed in
who gave you these priveledges son? why you PROFANITYng?
and we..
feigning to take those move slow
i'm hearing PROFANITYw you broke rob's nose
and i heard you keep a banging hammer
golden brass diamonds embroideries
that was stolen that you haven't reported g
make very little noise, my PROFANITY hiccup
don't make this big stick up bigger
me and the boys i thought for a second then chose
rather than froze
had the jim star on my hand
yo what the PROFANITY yo! that's when i ripped timothy
snatch and dip john like imbaggable
had the mini axe tool, faxed him
shots rang off, bing, boggle-de-dum

that splash against my PROFANITYllow bones
[intro: inspectah deck]

"oh baby, for heavens sake"

[verse one: inspectah deck/rebel ins]

yo, aiyyo my rap style swing like willie mays
my eyes purple haze, my solar razor burn through shades
my grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
i glide like, PROFANITYvercrafts on the everglades
boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
limited edition composition spark friction
non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
wu original, true colors step from the melanin
the most high, most try, to get close by
and overthrow i, but choke, with they PROFANITYpes up high
i circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the richter
flies sense to flock when they spot this live PROFANITY
the crowd PROFANITYr black your third eye before i lose ya
verbal high i leave stars in the eyes of medusa
top ten, parley like cochran, it's often
narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
murder rap, PROFANITY you soft like roberta flack
words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks

wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake" 
[repeat both lines 4x]

[verse two: masta PROFANITYa]

now all pay tribute to this entity
a spark that surges through the undergrowth
overwhelmin the populace from the entry
the wu-tang dynasty, has emerged
from this elite fleet
i was appointed to strike the vital nerve
mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
seeds of mc's at these fake PROFANITY industry PROFANITY
feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
and spray, an array of shots
that travel downwind, just respect pyrhiffic pen
as i send, the minds of the weak
to rise and take power i blew tower-ing over the land
as we stand, expanding our cream
a dollar to every grain of sand
let the mind use the physical as planned

"oh baby, for heavens sake"
wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake"

[verse three: cappadonna]

yo, yo, this is beirut
try to comprehend check out my new suit
gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
dissapear from here, my year, drop the PROFANITY lp's everywhere
fallin out the sky tall PROFANITY
raps by cappadonna hit the countryside
poetry whirlpool, rza and true collide
we PROFANITYuce article exception to the rule
we the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
cats that made that watergate thing go spoiled
the heavy-handed, locked down stranged with cyrus
wu pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
low down PROFANITY, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
slang reverand, put the best work in

wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake"
[repeat both 4x]

at 3:47, more than 150 rounds of ammunition were fired into your apartment
which was about 200 yards away
a few moments later, another fifty to seventy five rounds were fired in the street
and you're gonna stand here and tell me you didn't see a PROFANITY thing?

[u-god]
i live life lavish, and my chain is carats

and my name engraved in granites

yeah, you moving sideways, change your habits
yeah, used to rock minks, then i change to rabbit

used to be righteous, then changed to savage
bang my ratchet like bangkok dangerous
36 chamber fists, trianglist
watch me mangle this, star spangle this
rock cowboy wrangle it, create mega hits
i'm from the grain, game at my finger tips

[interlude: cappadonna]
yeah, PROFANITYah hill lay it down
killa beez on the swarm

[cappadonna]
aiyo, i plow down tracks like i'm out for revenge
fuck it, it seems like the drama never ends
be in the projects, like i never left out
might be on odds goods, see a PROFANITY stressed out
i can't take it, seems like my PROFANITYod is cursed
bad PROFANITY, i thought that the good was first
my old hawk she march with a foul parade
don't learn PROFANITY, til another child is sprayed
i'm out here, PROFANITY it, like i live on targhee
and rico, keep a low cut like laundry
i don't give a PROFANITY, ya'll made me bitter
i'mma whip your kids out like a babysitter
i'm a grown man, but i'm young in the mindstate
live in every borough but new york my tri state
test me, you nothing but a PROFANITY on the tour bus
pour PROFANITY on you, leave you stuck with four months
my head PROFANITY up, i'm off my clean streak
don't make me pick the nines up, i come from mean streets
my unit snitched on me, ratted me out
they all ganged up on me, try to take my mouth
however the cause, i'mma chill and get bent
that cut from PROFANITY cloth who cut from cement
original tazeen got the crazy glow
them devils try to jump me, i'm crazy though
absolut PROFANITY rap, crushing that goose
o.g. all day, like i be on the deuce
pop off with it, get your army in order
staten africa, islam, across that water

[interlude: cappadonna]

nigga i be where the stoupe is

[bronze nazareth]
yeah, told 'em, have gun will travel
blowing herb metals, black son still gravel
bronzeman, oblong javelins in my cabinet
detroit submit seeds, salutation from the missile plant
quick to the PROFANITYllow point, it ain't no olive branch
my low cal, four oh cal in the cardigan
tempted by satan, put a bullet in his diaphram
walk around black clouds and quiet violins
italian fire blends, poet and violent pens
illest ill, scotch deal, plots and iron winds
up hill near the ghetto spill, the sirens sing
street dreams, black seed and the inspired kings
from fire water veins, still rain mystery
and chains due to my roots, no doubt in the ring
on the road to riches and diamond speech
i might turn a bag and wash sand in the mountain peaks

[rza]
yo, i don't text to send messages
my testosterone stimulate her estrogen
whether black, caucasian or the mexican
asians, she get the message and she coming back for PROFANITY again
organic drugs, my natural persuation
you under the influence of 36 invasion
spider-man amazing, but i'm darker than parker
skin got abrasions from maria and tasha
sliding down a street pole, pull up to your party
stimulated with a jeep full of cherry gap PROFANITYneys and bottles of PROFANITY
plus the PROFANITY bowls, here we go
meditating, never jealous, over zealous
wu-tang clan's my fellowship, fans massive acapellas
of our lyrics, would be with tracks embelishes
the idea clearer that wu-tang forever
this, way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness
enjoying by PROFANITY, no man could sever this
i complete jobs, free and effortless
use tiger crane, snake style plus the leopard fist
[ghostface PROFANITYah]
this was my favorite girl for years, she knows the way i perform
sometimes i pull my boxers down, ya'll, with one timb on
it be times, you know i stay away when her friends on
for some reason, she be really PROFANITYt, when her friends gone
that's when i slide on over with a guinness on the stouffer
to talk a little PROFANITY, then get a little closer
like, what up boo, you know that ghost loves you
i get PROFANITYerflies when we hug and kiss, do you?
huh? answer me, let me if it's the truth now
that pretty mole above your lips looking cute now
ooh child, i'm patient, my mind's telling me
to stay calm, i wanna get it off like a g bomb
on top of your skin, i'm sliding it in
when i'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again
then we can PROFANITYld on through the night, fan on and covers on
it's bright from the tv light, peace, good night

[tre williams]
looking out my window, sun shining bright
birds are singing, trying to make things right
now i got music, oh, on my radio
and i can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors
now i don't want no one, on the catch me side
but ever since you left, said goodbye

[chorus: tre williams]
i wish you were here with me
i said i wish you were here with me
i wish you were here, with me

[tre williams]
and thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me
seen our love, is never gonna find me
and i keep looking, oh, for that brighter day
when all i see is, time slipping away
oh and i got to talk, to keep myself together
but all i see is stormy weather

[chorus]

[tre williams]

[chorus]

[tre williams]

the wind blows and i turn to catch ya
but there's no one there but my reflection
no, oh i said i wish you was here with me
[rza]
yo... this song is...
aiyyo dunn this song is called sunshower
cause we approachin the final PROFANITYur
you know i ahh all i can say to my brothers and sisters right now
is stay close to your families, and all your loved ones
cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
they PROFANITYin for pennies, knahmsayin?
peace to the PROFANITYs, we got a heavy job... yo, yo

trouble follows behind a wicked mind, 20/20 vision
of the prism of light but still blind
because you lack the inner, every sinner
will end up in the everlastin winter of PROFANITYfire
throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
you cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out
you remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external
along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
and permanently upon this journey
through the journal of the book of life
those who took a life without justice
will become just ice ice ice
it's been taught that your worst enemy can harm you
as much as your own wicked thoughts
what devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint
now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
iron PROFANITY with the strong blend of PROFANITY and blend of sandal
with rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans
burn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
i'm convinced, allah is PROFANITY always has been always will be
you could travel every square inch of the planet earth and still be
ninety-three million miles away from the sun
til you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge
know the ledge to where your heart is
or fall off into the internal PROFANITY that's uncharted
light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second
through time and PROFANITYe, until it reach a target
and once we're freed of darkness, and show em where the path
yo as the red sea was parted, into these straight
at the narrow gate, but why that's a road to destruction and hate
what you thought life was a sport? a game?
one PROFANITYdred years short, know the soul is immortal
walk through many portals, and those who go astray
will pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked PROFANITY
ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
with dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate
instead, i chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
of life and fed PROFANITY degree of light to my head
it's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so i stay awake
and take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin
so we can see each other, cause every color
that makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?
who's the original, who's the biochemical
who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital
digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

two PROFANITYdred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
while PROFANITY minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
the sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em
stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum
and shatter bone fragments
cops love the block you gettin backed up by dragnet
thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
flippin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block PROFANITYody's havin it
those who haven't learnt get returned
you freaky PROFANITY PROFANITY get burned
some walk around like they ain't concerned
with the PROFANITY goin on inside the world
why do grown men PROFANITY little girls?
is it because the girl's breast has swelled
to the size of a woman, although she's twelve
the whole world is sick, sick, sick
trapped up in six, six, six
i started off as a PROFANITY in this marathon of life
tryin to carry on, wishin i had a bomb to blow up babylon
a PROFANITYabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon
goin in circles, like a ferris wheel
undernourished meals i cherish PROFANITYpe, drown inside the sea of life
use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night
to far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
you couldn't see a spark of light
while others play ball, i recall, me and gza, PROFANITY
hangin in halls, bangin on walls
kickin rhymes three PROFANITYurs straight with no pause
boostin from freeport sunrise to amityville morgue
kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws
started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
to wearin long cables that PROFANITYg down to the navel
so pack some PROFANITY and fat sacks of skunk
to funnel the p-funk, smokin woolie blunts
dust PROFANITYtails and primos, shot more dice than casinos
back when wu-gambinos were called f.o.i. mc's
all and together now crew b.c.c.
rec posse, g.p., d.m.d.
ol PROFANITY stalked east new york gza maintained franklin lane
i was going to thomas the jeff, where students got slain
old earth got nervous walked me to shaolin sent me to curtis
took share time in marquis, u-god general contractin service
while PROFANITY chef and deck was off the nu-dol
for white boys who took steroids
buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
back when our girlfriends was PROFANITYs
cuttin class with ghost tryin to bag PROFANITYs in mary birchem
a maybeldine beacon night school washington irving
these young PROFANITYs was seekin
hoes in westinghouse and clara parton and medina
girls who sung like sarafina
on the corner of belmont and picket avenue i seen her
as if i dreamed her
i was dead broke, now i will use key notes to make g-notes
so it's always PROFANITYpe
see subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
to the heart of medina, but shaolin is the brain
so take heed to these words
and feel the power of the sunshower

approachin the final PROFANITYur
power equality, allah sees everything
let's come together under the wings
and take flight, wu-tang, the saga, ryzarecta

[intro: aesop rock]
yeah... riff raff...
uh, weathermen, hieroglyphics, what up? ok

[aesop rock]
riff raff, alley, when i boom slang, drip draft
venom with a new twang, same swagger, new thang
whose gang, a stagger with similar PROFANITY worms
who occasionally cluster up the service and observe
a.r. periscope, blast through the terror dome
zoo wanna shark attack, clash til the thrill is gone
bark back, fresh off the pharmacy, counter doubter pop
blame it on the overly, eggy, farming a power crops
dark wing when i pioneer deer, croppin' the odds
with all the proper sparkers and cogs
i bounce with a seventh sin, equipped with a foul jour moment
waiting for that great celebrity towel throwing

[del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
and you PROFANITY know what time it is, it's preservation
the national guard, it's me and aesop
rock, stopping any operations against the fence
del is quick to dispense, with foreign elements
back, y'all the anchor attribute to the decay
strives who plays, map your route, cause aesop is absolute
del? he practice shoot, basket PROFANITYops, capture fools with lasso loops
hip PROFANITYp needs two veterans such as us, who ain't never scared
to tear it there, hard to tell, vegetarian and aware of it
therefore, tearing can take care of it, ok, ok

[aesop rock]
i bang on doors, pay rent, lampin' to birth complaints
rip flipper, make rap music during commercial breaks
starring galapagos island, evolution mutant
through the one man species, shaking leaches off his puma's
beach run ashore, on PROFANITY, and contaminated play
spout try'nna out the older alligator fade away
make us stay, please, i chisel the missile gently
blast in the wagon, PROFANITY, condescends me
green earth PROFANITY, walk a right plank, he burst one
but yo, keep the rugged play, i'm never stumped
aes' hid the drum, keep paint under his lung, PROFANITY
who can know a dog runs more than a rutty puppy

[del tha funky PROFANITYsapien]
you better have appreciation for this
d-e-l, i'm so PROFANITYgry, man, i'm tastin' the PROFANITY
and the, girl you just replaced an abyss
and it's a PROFANITY, just needle action, like an itch
the only reason why i like to strike it rich
is to be able to keep the flow, that's PROFANITYw deep it go
[intro: rza]
hahahahaha, steels...
you bout to catch this vick
yo, you bout to catch this vick

[rza]
old sad ballads and gun permits was invalid
raspberry vinegar, red dripped in spinach salad
sippin' PROFANITY, cabanet grape, steaming halibat steak
gold plate is stainless, four forks scrape the single plate
chased by a shot of scotch whiskey, brew brisky
for sixty years, misty bottles of crysty in the freezer
red twist leaf, melted in spliffy, cali blunt piff
now we lifty, mc dread head, split up and smoke swiftly
then if we empty the safe we can all catch fifty
vanna piece put eighty five in jewelry
two sixty in deep, a half a gallon digi
when dog mentioned hingie, then when they tempted me
all up a nine milli', i brought my wild cousin billy
this PROFANITY wu hater, from off of decatur
bout to get smacked silly, kinetic was like
yo, bobby, don't act illy, let me handle this PROFANITY
we rolled the candle sick spliff, we PROFANITYpped inside the whip
and through the gear on shift, about to catch this vick

[chorus 2x: rza]
it's the season of the vick, PROFANITY, you getting hit up
with so much weight, so much lead, you won't be able to get up

[rza]
yo, kick in the door, spit a lungie at him, son, tried to PROFANITYie
grab 'em, through 'em on the floor, smacked 'em, my dudes bout to stab 'em
bitch was in the bathroom, screaming, PROFANITYt bubble batch, steaming
you can tell from her face, she just finished swallowing PROFANITY
shut the PROFANITY up, open the safe up, no time to waste up
heard you been hating on wu-tang, we should burn your PROFANITY place up
he was like 'yo, bobby steels, chill, for real, please spare me'
billy put the gun to his face like 'bobby, go 'head, try to dare me'
i was like 'nah, son, chill, ain't necessary'
his bird was in the backround, still singing like a canary
told 'em, open up the safe or prepare for the mortiuary
when the gun starts to click, and we spit, that crazy scary
open it up, it was filled with drugs and jewelry and cash
and me, oh, i simply grabbed the digi
tied 'em up and gagged up, duct tape and paper bagged him
him and his PROFANITY, in the whip, yup, we back in the magnum
return to the dread spread, gave him his cut of the bread
rumor has it, billy duffed them other cuts with dead

[chorus 4x]
[man praying in hebrew during intro]

[intro: remedy]
feel this,
to all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds for the
countless victims and all their families of
the PROFANITYed, tortured and PROFANITYd, PROFANITY, robbed and persecuted
never again, to the men, women, and children.
who died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.
reuven ben menachum, yo..

[remedy]
yo my own blood, dragged through the mud
perished in my heart still cherished and loved
stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
families cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide
tossed to the side, access denied
6 million died for what? yo a man shot dead in his back
helpless women and children under constant attack
for no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding
yo it's freezing, and men burn in PROFANITY, some for squeezing
no PROFANITYpe for a remedy, nothing to believe
moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your PROFANITYy
late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty
having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions
deceived by the devils decisions, forced into a PROFANITY
death before dishonour for those men who were brave
shot and sent to their grave, can't awaken, it's too late
everything's been taken, i'm shaken, family, history, the making

[chorus: remedy w/ israel's anthem]
never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
never again shall we sit and take orders
stripped of our culture, robbed of our name
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
forced from our families, taken from our PROFANITYmes
moved from our PROFANITY then burned of our bones
never again, never again, shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
leave our sons and daughters, PROFANITYped of our culture
robbed of our name
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
forced from our families, taken from our PROFANITYmes
moved from our PROFANITY and everything we own

[remedy]
some fled through the PROFANITYors of wars
but most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
with just one loaf of bread, banished, PROFANITYld in for questioning
and vanished, never to be seen again, i can't express the pain
that was felt in the train to auschwitz, tears poured down like rain
naked face to face, with the master race, hatred blood and david
my heart belongs to PROFANITY and stay sacred
rabbi's and priests, disabled individuals
the poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
mass extermination, total annihilation
shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
tortured and starved, innocent experiments
stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
the last PROFANITYur, i smelled the flowers
flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
powerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest
crying, who would've guessed -- dying, another life lost
count the cost, another PROFANITYy gas burned and tossed in the PROFANITYlocaust

[chorus]

[outro: remedy]
never again, never again
the final solution is now retribution
remedy, wu-tang..

[nas:]
when i was hearin' about wu-tang, i kept hearin' about these dudes, they were comin' to places, tearin' PROFANITY up, everywhere they went. and it was like, they was-they was makin' a mark, and i kept hearin' the, the name and i knew, i knew somethin' was comin' with it, you could tell, you could just feel it.

i remember bein' around wu and i'm like, um', "damn, they just like us." you know what i'm sayin', the, the raekwon remind me of this guy, ghost remind me of this guy around my way. it was like cousins almost, it was like, you know, project kids. that's what it-that was the language, project kids. we felt it, we smelt it off each other, and it just shows you, out of those PROFANITYusing projects come some brilliant people.

the special thing about wu-tang bein' eight or nine guys was, each one was a rapper who could represent their own individual self within that crew. they were the example for all of us, 'cause we haven't, we didn't really see that before, like more power to them, and show love to them, respect them, you know. they're PROFANITYnorable. they gave us incredible skill. they gave us incredible poetry. and they gave us music that no one's touchin' to this day. it's timeless.

[verse 1 - masta PROFANITYa:]
look, PROFANITYmicide is illegal, death is a penalty
never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
iâll never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
i throw a great entre dart arrow to your temple
allmighty [?] to the insidious
plan of the wu-tang clan became a world brand
we never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show

[verse 2 - gza:]
never let go of your mind
itâs a terrible thing to waste
to lose, but itâs very hard to find
being that ignorance is lethal
we must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
never let go of your plan, execute
so when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
never lose knowledge of yourself
for it may become risk to your health
and great loss of wealth

[verse 3 - PROFANITYod man:]
never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
players retire, but they never let go of the team
if you a rider then you never let go of that thing
pull up your mansâ like you better let go of that bling
this lifeâs crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
thatâs just the PROFANITYod lately, never let go
iâm what the PROFANITYod made me
momma told me to find a good lady

[verse 4 - inspectah deck:]

set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
take the real life by the rings and i ainât letting go
i ainât letting go

[chorus:]

[verse 5 - u-god:]
never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
my PROFANITYnesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
and memory of those who have passed to the other side
never letting go, iâm never letting go of my beliefs
my faith, convictions, real
both hands PROFANITYlding on, never let go the wheel
we PROFANITYod legends, misunderstood
these lessons, learned
growing up for manhood
keep focus on the prize what you better do
a little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
states whatâs ahead of you, always on the schedule
smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
letting go, is something that i never do
those who let go, live life regrettable
never let go of your PROFANITYpe or your rope
eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
when iâm in jail, never let go of the soap
hold on, boy, never let go

[verse 6 - rza:]
never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
never let go your heart, or the place you started
the feeling that i had, wu-tang had just charted
the old earth departed, i give thanks to the martyrs
i never let go the love i have for thy father
never let go the glow
the more i know the more that it shows
i wonât let go, even if i decompose
your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
pass the baton, life is just the marathon
and ain't' playing to win it, itâs an epidemic
never let go, thatâs what the PROFANITY recommended

[chorus]

[sample - martin luther king:]
and there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america. the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is PROFANITY with our destiny. and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom

[killah priest:]

my PROFANITYlster, under my armpit, millenium garments
arabic fabrics, while smoking up the bones of mohammed
blowing out the smoke of opression, PROFANITYlding my weapon
hairs came from the robe of a peasant, touch my heart
priest see white PROFANITYies in the dark, soon as my ink touch my king tut

mc's don't be discouraged, come again, don't be a stranger
[*sound of bomb dropping*]

[method man:]

shoot-outs, hang glides on the train ride
mafia's PROFANITYassins, PROFANITY's inside
fat man with the pinky ring laughin'
movin' the static through traffic
the PROFANITYss, boss called the dragon
his head's bald, enemies are mauled
his hands are claws, cigar's lit, targets are hit
his broad is fit with the largest PROFANITY

punches hit with nautical drifts, spark up the spliff
chris samurai, mesmerized, strikes cleaner than sanitize
you fantasize, real, couldn't show it more if i pantomime
bronx symphony, stomp lyrically, chomp PROFANITY mcs
earn mine, wouldn't even give you PROFANITY my sympathies
feelin' me? said you feelin' me, you PROFANITY feelin' heat

i'm takin this rap PROFANITY back from the wack
fuck who you are kid, PROFANITY where you representin
and after, basically my mentality is on some '93 PROFANITY

to be an mc, now it's al about the tight clothes
crossover flows, platinum jewelery to get a plaque in the industry
but never the i-s-l-o-r-d, i keep my PROFANITY muddy

plus there ain't no way to escape him
on the fire escape with the narocotic from the one-two-oh

divine mind, i power rule, united nation
my dj's spinnin the latest from the out the crates and
killarm's rockin the stage like a brigade and
my own congress, government rocket launchers PROFANITY
strikin on ya five consciouses
narces men didn't know i put the toxic in

i'd blow gun powder right off of he shelf
my brain power cause a rain shower
restrain cowards, pull out to the heat and flame at ours

[9th prince]
aiyyo
a soviet deep in paris, PROFANITY rabbits want carrots
luxury marriage, life, ain't havin it
i keep the forty-five automatic like mathematics
start terminatin savages, i'm raw like 'caine to easy addicts
street tactics, layin down the caskets
on biblical war, perform michael jackson thriller but way iller
a PROFANITY PROFANITYer, protected by shaolin and brooklyn zu guerillas
under my pillow, i sleep with grenades, untraceable heaters
stay deeper than scientific readers
my cipher sounds will ding pound, i blast you on ya nightgown
kidnap ya child, might give him to the crowd
on my way uptown in my '95 millenium
seen PROFANITYa sin and 'em, that PROFANITY sound feminine
remember 9th prince, i'll forever get up in 'em

[killa sin]
killa loco, vocals PROFANITYld you hostage
gothic, size out live PROFANITY, catch a wise quick, focus
we stone fist explosive, load 'em like fo'-fifths
to roast clicks, ferocious as ro-bitch, with no cinch
my thoughts so dense they form mist
i swarm quicker than norm, my bee stingers stay dipped in corn liquor
warn PROFANITY from the last time, my past time PROFANITYbby be
robbin PROFANITY in they lobby, g, come out ya wallabees
fifty-six penny-weight chain limit the policy

[chorus x2]

[intro: movie samples]
man you know there used to be rules to this PROFANITY
nowadays people do whatever the PROFANITY they want
and worry about that PROFANITY later
that's the general mentality out here kurt

you ain't hearin me
you wanna play this game
you can't cry when the game play you
yeah
ten g mics and PROFANITY

mics and men, books and pen
decent rhymes, PROFANITYoks and lines
one time, where do we begin?
the gritty rugged lands of shaolin
where proud men went from moving PROFANITY rocks to moving mountains
moving crowds and making mothers proud now
walk out of places where our people wasn't allowed in
i took a high-hat, a snare, and a kick drum
a bass, a g-note, turned it into hit songs
now every we make forty gâs, PROFANITY please, PROFANITYa bees
pay a quarter mill for the emcees at night, aight?
i kick it like a nike flight
25 years later, who thought that we could be greater?
the name of wu-tang gets spread on both sides of the equator
the rzarector grew to be a movie director
still smoke blunts with the PROFANITY and rock mics with inspectah
still crash bars with shallah
and my brother devon, he still push the flyest cars
but he added a yacht to his repertoire
and they marvel PROFANITYw the jugger still caked with tony starks
while the rza and u-god still shake the fã©ru d'arts
cappadonna try to put a PROFANITYle inside your heart
jamal ari push that chess piece across the board
with the sound of a sword bein' released from its sheath
and olâ PROFANITY shimmy shimmy ya from beneath
and power still got that rugged gear in the streets
it's wu-tangs, mics and men, we PROFANITYer bees
mathematics stay craft-matic on the beats

i'm in the mkx with the opposite PROFANITY
trying to take her from the suburb back to the projects
money, chicks, fast cars, that's my obsess
i ain't obligated to nothing except contracts
honey do you do PROFANITY, PROFANITY is still contacts
lovin' the babes daily, feedin' 'em blowback
canât let nothing walk by but a bubble PROFANITY
get money, pop bottles, then we double the cash
slip by the shop, other PROFANITYâll fall back
see PROFANITYine on the ocean in the yacht
flip money bags when our hulu PROFANITY pop
ferragamo belt with the gucci bought
yo, you can't tell me nothing bout the coogi, hah
when i was the one out there making the PROFANITY PROFANITYt
when you was in the spot, you was just a young snot
i was in the ball game pitching the rock
wu-tang forever, we always on grind
like diddy told you, we ainât never gon' stop

man, have you not heard that one word given will have you missing
listen to the fly piano, wu-gambino soprano
deck and dino, owners of their own casino
rza keynote, stoudemire, young amar'e
flow PROFANITYtter than the kalahari
skipping off the rim of the snare
every rhyme line rich without the line combined
with the power refined
see my mind shine brighter than einstein
shallah pen bleed then the dawn is my time
so run, tell a friend, you can check it on showtime
it's wu, mics and men
[doc doom:]

platinum grill, re-enforced solid steel
superstar engine, force of an eighteen wheel
that'll crash through brick walls, smash intersections
move through ya city PROFANITYed with police protection
heated polished seats with back PROFANITYges
you gotta know PROFANITYw to roll in more like kenny rogers

while they spin, you freeze in ya souped up paint clean
fifties, amps, six by nines and thangs
comin down the block, let my sub straight bang

i love to floss as i toss up a fifth of that crown
bank corner after corners, watch all the PROFANITY's smile

[chorus x3.5]
yoyoyoyoyoyo! yo

peep the inspectah deck (you know they ain't ready for it)
lyrical threat
representing wu-tang
slang, ninety-five
hittin it live
you know what time it is

blessed with the art rhymes that's sharp like a circular saw
hit the floor like dorf, who wants the war
then slide by my, lyrical drive by
chops rush, making black hearts bust, plus knifes they got
when they rush, built like construction tools
crushing fools, in twos
forced dude to blast you out your PROFANITY shoes
a south swap with the bombs i drop
plan a to terrorize you can't stop the plot
execution of an amateur, who dared to challenge the
clansman, PROFANITYlding a sword like excalibur
truth is my shield, show and prove i reveal
reality, a coldness the heart can feel
livin life where caps PROFANITYl, and PROFANITY deals from nine to five
but i survived in these hard times i nearly died
now i'm wanted by death i did escape
now it's thrown on a tape with those who can relate
still i wrap my face take a PROFANITYe in the staircase
hits takin place, yo PROFANITY, watch the jakes
out of state court dates, chase me with the warrants
for my insurance, switched names to michael lawrence
the rebel, stomps through the slums i'm from
coming through with nuff PROFANITY, and nuff guns to bust son
so read the article, lyrical PROFANITYassin with the PROFANITYnal
potential witnesses are incapable
of testifying, i won't be frying in the chair
plus the case closed, i won't be ever shackled, and safe clothes
i make foes, exasperates then, i make friends
cause today's friends, show theyselves as snakes in the end
and if you fit the trend then protect ya neck
shaolin, ins, PROFANITYa hill projects

no one on this earth, can PROFANITYld me
no one on this earth, can fool me
no one on this earth, can grip the mic
like, i, do, PROFANITY

you ever, feel, that you can
test me, you got to face the clan and
never, return to the mic again
there's no one in the world

let me at them! i blast off lyrics like a magnum
forty-four caliber, bustin mad PROFANITYles in my challenger
tongue in your throat is swiss cheese
the wild freestyler, wild like gene wilder
wu-tang PROFANITYa bee aimed at your brain
with my stinger, it stun your mind, when i bring ya
thirty-six chambers of anger, frustration
for waiting, to let loose on the nation
far from commercial no need for no rehearsal
hit you from all angles then form a circle
go against the grain within close range
when i slam, like onyx, come get some, that's a promise
i'll represent, here's the evidence
science of mad PROFANITY plates i make sense
my technique of speech is deep, like leviathan
hittin up your block with rhymes, like a firing
shooting for the platinum, then bring it back to
the same place i got the gat from, let me at them

[chorus: ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY]

[rza:]
yo
the wick is lit, the bombs start to tick, tick, tick
countdown, bza bobby 'bout to spit
explode every mc in a four mile radius
still mad with stout like i'm doctor octavius
place to brace, i could push on a rival plate
the pulse of a digi stare, make a spiral break
mouth the rhyme, blow his man outside the orbit
who ever thought this PROFANITY hip-hop wasn't goin' corporate
and PROFANITYn weight like chinese put on eight dragon
and 'w' on the flag and and everybody's braggin'
neightborhood wiggin' out cuz the PROFANITY's livin' out
without biggin' out, wu-tang clan biggin' out
hollywood political wished off, it is yourz
ready for the next lp to hit stores
i got more serious, my smoke be furious
my night time walk should be named to nigerious
it crucified you upside down on a wooden cross
shouldn't have doubted the trojan, threw you in a wooden PROFANITYrse
ol' PROFANITY break these PROFANITY off
you be PROFANITY dumb soft

[chorus: w/ rza]

[interlude: rza]
boodoodoodoo!!! yo, yo, yo

[ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY:]
who want me to show the reels? i do magic spells
children love shootin' guns on devils PROFANITY
i want a girl that's only too meak to squeal
and wu-tang keep that PROFANITY concealed
roll with me in the drug mobile
fuck my PROFANITY, take it on the wheel
played it all over the world until
wu-tang secret now revealed
o's is PROFANITYin' all people for head over heals
i'm not a 'ciple with +little rascals+
villians, all attracted to my PROFANITY for man silk repellent
i'm not the well-in, white boys can't get with melon
i'm sayin' wu-tang is supreme to my wife and PROFANITY PROFANITY on tour
to make sure, insure, that my wife got paid while i was ditch poor

[chorus]

[outro: ol' PROFANITY PROFANITY]
ding PROFANITY ding, ding dong ding

goin out altogether cause we're co-defendants
got your back, take my front

[shyheim:]
i'm a n.w.a. with nineteen shot glizzy
i'm all PROFANITYged and krazyie, layzie, flesh, wish and bizzy
i'm too wild, you don't wanna see my act up
police gotta call the national guard for back up
my PROFANITY don't stink, i never touch my link
shyheim never sleepin, my eyes just cheat me
and my army moves same, same

[hell razah:]

yall PROFANITY on some frontin PROFANITY, amped off a drink
money like to bring truck, bomb you till you faint
i roll with top rank, soon to judge the angels sing

[shyheim:]
i'm ghetto like ?sun-do?, wu-tang clansman
we banned from the tunnel,

[hell razah:]
we're scorin touchdowns, well yall wack rappers fumble

[shyheim:]
and talk about the projects, we never see you come through
catch em at their shows, their hidin in a limo

[hell razah:]
we claimin donnie brasco, black robert deniros
we're PROFANITY street heros in the six double zeros

[shyheim:]
benz, glocks with the infer-red lenses
money over PROFANITY, like p, i'm infamous

[hell razah:]
thoughts is infinte, me and shy run together
like the current census

[shyheim:]
we're co-defendants, society's menace
i became a jon doe, so i be printed

[chorus: shyheim]

[hell razah:]
aiyyo, it's war faces, i see outside the court cases
see the first chapter become the bone PROFANITYy fracture
i roll with player haters, down to mat rafters
out to put the gat to anybody playin after
climbin up ?jacken's? latter, the common factor
red PROFANITYok, never shake hooks or get you PROFANITY took
black PROFANITYok indian givers with a sick hook

[shyheim:]
hit with the book, i was hit with the book
i'm a walkin timebomb, i smoke PROFANITY to keep me calm
it's like she said, "i'm a bad PROFANITY"
when she read my palms, i did armed PROFANITY felony
and with my moms tellin me, a twenty-seven d.v.d.
for reals and mad man, in a instant a raider
is where we stash the grills
it's all about the PROFANITYdred dollar bills, PROFANITY what
if shorty pushes you big, i stick it in her PROFANITY

[chorus x2: both]

[INS]
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!

Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this, anthem swing like Pete Sampras
Takin it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static, with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard

[Raekwon]
Ayo, ayo
Waves is spinnin, blades is spinnin
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playin linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 zitos, movin wit a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollyin deals, monopoly and bills
Y'all niggas lyin
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set
If I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke

[Meth]
Now what Clan you know wit lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through hell
Wit 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi auto wit no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck wit digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, takin all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in

[Masta Killa]
That's word to Jah Mo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip

[Bobby Digital]
Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin chess, studyin math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)

[Ghostface]
Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin out, yours is talkin
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs in the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out

[U-God]
Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White stiff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs

[Cappadonna]
You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryna get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime

[GZA]
Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin, without any knowin
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wildest nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow
[RZA]
Tempted by the sins of life, the pleasures of lust
With wild imaginings that you can't discuss
Oh, the flesh is weak, it's a struggle for feast
It's a daily conflict between man and beast
We, strive for God, and a better tomorrow
Still suffering, from the unforgettable sorrow
Repent from thy sins, son, and walk these straight
Stop talking all that trash, boy, and spark these straight
Evicted by the pressures of life, at every vital point
Still, I wouldn't give an oint'
Or, flinch an inch, or pitch a pinch
Off the pie, or every try to try your winch
Confronted by the devil himself, and stay strong
You think you can take the King, now meet Kong
Strong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting
How many MC's, have sprung from our fountain
Fifty thousand year process, to make this combination
I'm not, giving mine away to Satan
Although, I know that he's awaiting
To get ahold of my biochemical equation
I'mma slip him son, I'mma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'mma clip him, son
Fifty thousand year process, to make this combination
Ninety nine elements, biochemical manifestation
I'm not giving mines away to Satan
Although, I know that he's awaiting
I'mma slip him son, I'mma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'mma clip him, son

[MF Doom]
Bet oc', straight to the head with the pet rock
At least til I can get from out this booth, it's like a sweat box
Trained a few bars of head nodding, throw us a stack
Pants militant sawed up like linen, bobbing bonus pack
Invest in the first b-boy kid show, life on skid row, with jive talking negro's
He wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly
And kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he?
Is he in the backyard, or on your front porch
Or standing in the corner of the club, with the blunt torched
You're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving
And sold odds and bob kins, to old gods and goblins
Valley, adjust a pest and your worst best friend
Who mending with space time fabric like polyester blend
Not a hobby for no body, lead less from men
Or sloppy like the rest of them, they probably need estrogen

[RZA]
Yo, yo, drunk or sober, son, don't lose your composure
Semi off the Remy, mixed with Henny, Moet demi'
Underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'
Israeli issued, automatic black pistol
The cop with the flashlight, chew gum as he whistle
Tapped on the glass, roll it down fast
License, registration, addressed to your lab
They made insurance, the reason why I pulled you over
Cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober
Have you been drinking? Breathe into the breathalyzer
Get out the car, please, follow this exerciser
Put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe
Walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road
My homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato
On cartwheels, and then spin house like whirled tornado
That used to chase the light, but, son, he will always save ya
Becoming pump blows, and make beats inside my basement
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer
We civilize the uncivilized cuz we supposed to
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Might give your hand, black man stand as a soldier
Stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer...
[Intro:]
Okay God it's like this
If we don't manifest our power to the fullest
Man, you know what I'm saying?
Nothing will become of everything that we plan

Understand and understood God
See we goin' show them the strength in what we doing
Cause this is for he babies (indeed)
That's why it's on the strength
Everything is on the strength

[Verse 1:]
Simultaneous anger to this life I'm no stranger
Galaxy mission to attack in the track black
Diplomats in the world called rapture
Death was a concept I didn't want to capture
The laughter singing over? mantress d?
Street colleagues slow up,
Their man got tow up
Guts be throw up sipping on rum
We sing from the creed of a begger's last son
Cash fast fun, no life undone
Take what you need son cause you daddy made mo' than one
And it was fun 'till reality formed screaming
From a palace where the weather's warm
Yo you have to be the father and the lord of the score
Used to hover here now it's cutting your vocal cord
No mo' speaking the lies to the weak
'Cause I'm about killing these guys with my feet
Today it's a stage maybe later it's a cosmic course
The general I be rocking on the horse
On the strength of course don't let it be in vain
Cause it's time for The Beggaz to reign, remain

[Verse 2:]
A vision my facility a death world trilogy (you see that shit)
Now fictional plots speak out through gunshots
Battles won and lost at the of heaven's throne
The sky rains blood drowning the earth with red mud
I be sitting on the edge of Mars counting stars
Finding me a place in space unchaseable
No mortal can't fulfill such skill they incapable
Of keeping all the planets in-line with one mind
Make the sun and moon both shine at one time
I orchestrate the guns that air for God's sake
Precipitate make rain, hail, snow and earthquake
Levitate the gravitational pull of Haleys comet
Shake the chords of earth make a euro-volacanic vomit
Ebonic with sonic waves that blaze the human flesh
It flames extra-terrestrial it's time to reap professional
Feel the untestable force burning your course
Hints of visible thoughts be the source of Begga sorcery
... Begga sorcery

[Chorus:]
ON THE STRENGTH
Time is money and gain
ON THE STRENGTH
Math is one and the same
ON THE STRENGTH
Whining is something for pain
ON THE STRENGTH
Beggaz for ever remain
[repeat]

[Verse 3:]
Buddah Hava who lives the ways by nature
Escape on a galactic space caper
To the nexus, transportation a glass Lexus
Forever present is Wu Chi in the essence
Of life is immortal
We travel through portals that's phenomenon,
Paragon through the octagon
My Chi gong is calm, express through Alvatron
Love hell alright is the day destroys the night
Knife divides today feathers are harmonious
And universal ways to escapades
We take what we need to survive and stay alive
Draw more sometimes as we break through the other side

[Verse 4:]
The Knoliton master law and order
Astrolgoic civilize the human family throughout the populous
Live forever like metabolics
Everything I speak has logic
Estimated all partsman of the chief king fistboxin'
Inscribe within the Begga doctrine
Manual infold I roll protect my physic
From elements of the globe
We communicate like space probe,
Remainder of the square frag the author
Of the final chapter seven star grandmaster
Pugilist John Trappa M.D.
Go-go thirteen professional MC
I bomb squads like Hank Sharpley
Expose a fraud like hardcopy
I know click and shoot like paparazzi
With the never conclusive euro language of usage
Street persona, my thought is blacker than the pre-madonna
Far and beyond, If lickin' who warfare like Sadam
Invade everyone like Ghangis Khan
Forever will remain
And the Beggaz will continue go on...

[Chorus]

[mixing then fade away]
[RZA]
Wait, hold up, chill, what's that son?
Damn.. nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point sun
Hold tight grip on the +God-U..Now+ you best be careful!
Can't dodge two (??) aimed at your domepiece
+Father-U-C-King+ police!!

[U-God]
Somethin in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Somethin in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum

[Masta Killa]
Yo Rae it's been a long time son since we bust
Gunclap +Glaciers+, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B., on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a Masta!!

[Cappadonna]
Yo somethin in the street went, BANG BANG
Makin it hard for you to do your THANG THANG
Somethin in the street went, BANG BANG..

Up in the boss game wildin, money for grabs
I ain't fuckin with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave.
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryin to re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggaz in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggaz you can't trust, dealin with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James

Somethin in the street went, BANG BANG
Makin it hard for you to do your THANG THANG
Somethin in the street went, BANG BANG
Makin it hard for you to do your THANG THANG

[Ghostface Killah]
Somethin in the hole went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}
Somethin in the hole went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}

These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, razoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
to Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was coppin 6 G's
Begosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers

[U-God]
These (??) camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, ways, of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a hoe stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?

[Inspectah Deck]
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK

Made 'em throw they hands up, but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop backs that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhymin hero? Wu-Tang rules again

Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK

[Redman]
RZA came and got me, this what I came to do, come on
Ring the bell so it's time to eat
Brick Dog stash weed inta AMI-seats
Bomb isdide the palm
Doc rock a wifebeater with me beatin my wife ass iron dawn
The font of my appartment built like the Klumps
To carry it I take the spear out the trunk
I stay hungry, I ain't worked for days
That's why you see the pump when the curtains raise
Blast! Don't panic
Do I gotta explain how I tame and lock the rapgame single-handed?
Hell nah! I won't tell you son
If I find a wack ID I sell you one
Doc and Hot Nick, Inspectah
My lecture's like Hannibal Lecture's
Where's the ketchup?
Don't speak on it, shut ya trap
I see ya whole crew yellow like mustardpacks
Ah woo, Doc in my own zone
You say you got the rapgames on, but it's all wrong
I ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softy-truck
Then pull a Mack out a box and smoke hoes
Yeah, ya little fucks
Gimme ya fucking money!

[Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface]

[Method Man]
Uhuh, check it
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on
Playing with a dynamitestick, where did I go wrong?
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp
If ya lukewarm leavin ya clothes and boots torn
Pro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's
By arid actions try MC's to get their roll on
First issue got issues
What is hiphop to Hot Nickles
It's like Funk Docter's snot tissues, word
Look at my hand and get the third
Finger out ya earhole like: Fuck what you hear
Now that's what I call harcore, let's act fool
Mr. Fix-It like Handyman I pack tool
I been shitty, I'm from the veils of the city
And just because my outfit match don't make me pretty
Baggy Dun Gurees, dick need room to breathe
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
Ain't no rules to the game, if it hit we ain't planned
In your business like EPMD So What You Sayin'
You codesignin that bullshit yo man tryin
Chaka chaka cha-ta tatat!!
Slugs flyin

[Shout-outs from Raekwon, Ghostface and Inspectah Deck]

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, ya
Check, the code echos from magazines to the big screen
Fo' wheel machines like ya wits scream
Kids fiend from the urban to sub-urban
Roll upon me thirstin like: Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant
We roll longer than dice in a casino
Silo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0
Behind the tinted windows I lay low
On some hydro tryin to slide from the 5-0
But now I get wild similar to Ol' Dirty
On third time fellon just hit with over 30
No worries, style have em so thirsty
First degree heats are quittin on me
Cold turkey, no mercy
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines
But a thousand shoutin my name that's why I came
But first bring the cashburst, then the outburst
My surroundsound pound ya ear like ... curse
I flex muslce outside I find a next hustle
Trouble with ya here and face the TEC-muscle
Even the best buckle win
I take it to the exteme
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get cream
This life

[Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface]
[Intro Skit]
Someday I'm gonna be walkin down the streets,
mindin my own business.. and BAM!!
I'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna SWEAR
that it was a mistake.
I accept that as a part of my destiny!

(Si es mi destino morir en la calle como un perro! Hahaha)

[Raekwon the Chef]
Whattup kid? That's right..
Yo.. aiyyo.. aiyyo..

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Aiyyo let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo
Let my niggas live
We real niggas that's God-body, challenge anything, make major moves
Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron, no pryin rules
Let my niggas live; aiyyo let my niggas live
Handle your bid and kill no kids

[Raekwon the Chef]
Millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
Got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
Kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
Yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
That's that fire move like Schwinns yo
Invisible pens that write light, leave blends
Hit with the JF Kennedy shot
Smash with the Acapulco rifle got got
Bolt off, but got clocked
Legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
Design your alphabet, reps get graded
We in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
Home of Allah's ten big rooms
So what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
Exotic Gods bust my hammer at frauds
Call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
Gucci jumper X-5, gettin more head

[Chorus]

[Nas]
I scream at the mirror, curse, askin God, "Why me?"
Run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
I'm God-son, son of man, son of Marcus Garvey
Rastafari irie, Ha-ile Selassie
Police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
It takes more than metal bars, we destined for ours
I hear murder plans from dopefiends, with elephant hands
Snots in they nostril, the blocks is hostile
There's no pots to piss in, glocks is spittin
Rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
Drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
It drove lots of men to die with no name
I been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C.O. flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a New York state of mind, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors

[Chorus]
[Intro: Beretta 9 (RZA)]
Drip, drip
It's hot outside man (drop, drop) One, two
I know niggas is "Thirsty" (boodoodoodooodoodoo)
(Bobby Digital) One, two
It's hot outside (Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo)
About a motherfuckin' hundred degrees, humid
(Bo-Bobby, yeah, Digital)
And niggas is "Thirsty" (Di-Di-Di-Digital)

[Beretta 9 (RZA):]
Ayo, this I dedicate to niggas who bust guns
All my live niggas who sold Vamps and didn't "Run"
My juveniles wild to stay out past their curfew
A build upon life and drink beers like their pops do
A subject of the streets, yo kid it's "Burning Season"
Don't expose the joint without intentional reason
Summer time (Digital), dehydrated, niggas out to quench thirst
Quench thirst, we might want to stay in home, oh fuck it
Rock the camo', I got the ammo
A long shot, look like I play for the Knicks
So call me Rambo, Beretta 9, Killarm' recon' (Digital)
Rob me, I might rob you, then it be on

[RZA:]
Digital...
Radical "White Boy" push skate board, not Mountain Dew
Old splash, d'ya see that bright yellow shirt with the Wu W?
Faced you with the flight of a butter fly wing
Fierce as the eagle, sting of the underground beatle
Might wobble or fall down inside the squabble
In summer time, cracked the ice cold bottle
Take the swallow, and give all praises due to the true
And do the Dew, just do the Dew, do the Dew...
[Intro/Chorus: Madame D]
Light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
His partner was shady.. tryin to slave the babies

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyyo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the desk
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggaz know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner, he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
They call him desk duty, Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the block

[Chorus]

[Raekwon the Chef]
Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her
with the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
Wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggaz just smilin cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me (?)
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid

[Chorus]

[GZA]
You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about
livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin the door, the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to, stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggaz that's optical
Watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
And for some, another way out, is music and sports
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
that won the championship, with just oh on the clock

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
[Raekwon and Method Man:]
What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo

[Raekwon:]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!

[Method Man:]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Inspectah Deck:]
It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

[Method Man:]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Inspectah Deck:]
Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down

[Method Man:]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
[Timbo King]
The Legacy, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready

And held a breath of life, resurrect the death of Christ
What you got to sacrifice, I'm on some other shit
Takeover the mothership, brothers get to claim the covenant
Universal lovin it, olive oil you rubbin it
Check the thermometer, ever kilometer
Rise by heat pressure, your thermostat couldn't measure
Royal Familia, atoms bombs from Asquilia
Dark Ages, so read the page, Mike and Alenki
Born on the cross between love and lust
Genisis thru exeuse, larzurus, slash black barnibus
The holy temple be the mental, You and see Islamic
Can you understand the clear picture

[Chorus]
Braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar
Royal Fam Legacy, watch us travel far
Positive energy, always corrects errors, Royal Fam rule shit
Now and forever, what

[Timbo King]
Orotorical, niggaz is metaphorical
My editorial breaks down your monuments historical
Geologist studyin land, usin the earth's crust
Measurements, eight elements, atomic weight plus density
Hi-Techs, science, thrustal gravity
Revolve around my oro, I'm the soul that keeps spinnin, what
Supernova, black quasar, my mental radar picks up
Frequencies beyond the earth's equator
Forver glow, electro, magnetic force field
Thoughts build, we bomb for real, Royal Fam still exists
Golden fist, your caught up in the devil's mist
Fire war, royal sire laws, reveal this
Protons, electrons, atoms cause explosions
My center of atraction, I'm the nucleus, you're frozen
My square be complete, architectual, visual
The sound spectrum strikes the mental then the physical
My perimeter damns your diameter
Bar codes are scanned from America to Canada
What, from America to Canada

Get your mind ready

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Get your minds ready, Get your minds ready, Royal Fam Legacy
What, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready
[Littles]
I knew this chick by the name of Vevorine
Who introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game
We did in the rain, on the hood of a Range
But Vevorine, had a special friend called Heroin
She told me, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye
But back then, I ain't gon' front, I was peddling 'caine
In the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no
Cause it's a poor man's girl, and I will never give love
To how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was
Martin had a dream, nigga, I did too
To make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoup
So, I took it that thaw, and hit the street
With bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
Momma said, never get high on your own supply
Especially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich
Reminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears
See the more money that comes in, the more I disappear
Fresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear
New Year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear
Watch this strip, make me back it up, D'Angelo knows the feeling
Off that needles warm embrace, in a sexual heeling
This tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
Watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
I'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past
Baby, you gotta trust me, cause I gotta girl and you got a man
I don't want you to judge me, I just wanna be your friend
Baby, you gotta trust me...

[Khalid]
Aiyo I live by the rules, trust nothing in skirts
Cause with that big butt and a smile, she be waiting to flirt
With a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt
Another dick in the jaw, more dick in the george
While you home sleeping, she creeping, you thinking it's yours
That's just how women is, I reminisce
On when I had to learn from experience, why they call you a bitch
And I ain't the best, but I ain't never denied
Tell me what nigga, flow sicker, spit shit better than mine
The plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time
You get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine
I'm on the grind, I don't settle for mines, nigga
With this track, a broad, with a pack, before I peddle a dime
Line for line, whose the best artist, the rest y'all garbage
But it's awkward, it's ass backwards, they still spinning your garbage
It's me, blunt: the artist, y'all niggaz is garbage

[Planet Asia]
Sweat jackets valor, rap money, looking like crack money
Relax, money, niggaz, it's raw, sweet aromatic
Backwood, fanatic nigga, this is Cali
Vigilante's tattered, the wife beaters and khakis
I'm taking over, cause y'all, cooking too much baking soda
B12, rock selling niggaz vacation's over
Medallion's guaca', only rock a three piece suit
Whenever holding case, the cops try to stop us
My henchmen behind me, in black benz's with big toppers
Get up on my life, nigga, the kid's proper
Wrist glint, the big shit, cult following fans be vixen
This is grown man business, pay attention
Or lay your position, fuck around and have a fatal collision
The moment where you should of made your decision
I made it, I'm living, I'm paid and I'm winning
From the aid of my wisdom, I created a system
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable

Are you, my judge?

It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

[Verse One: U-God]

Yo, yeah, yo, yo
Yo, yeah
Check these high hats sting things moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, eruptments conduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers people of colors we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red left his
mic half a dangle, seriouser man
My mic clapper def wish, everlasting plan
heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seem a
kiss of spider, to God saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters

Number two, Chao San Poi

[Verse Two: The Genius/GZA]

This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this, and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggaz - perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggaz look on, and get hooked on this mic line
Real thin and shift through the pipeline
LP's delivered with style and potential
Niggaz flowin smoothly in a sequential
order, revealin hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura

[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]

Twist the DAC up, them niggaz with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground maneuver, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick she's German Luger
Get the shit on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
with the seal on Dunn, deal on this, with the real on
Next, Rocky, ring, call it to Decatur
Slang soufleer home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me

[Verse Four: Prince Rakeem/RZA]

Yo MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo one held his paraphenalia, a Wu memorabilia
Mailed by the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
bout the group recruit we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported
chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
and politic with Leo and Russell
When niggaz is still rushin we'll brush you

He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives

[Verse Five: Masta Killa]

Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
ignite, blowin the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggaz couldn't fuck with the
deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
look for means of survival and who's liable
for this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
and proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery

Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives

Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives

I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable

Are you, my judge?

It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable

Are you, my judge?

It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
"It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is LOOSE..somewhere in outer space."

"The mysteries of creation are there."

"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky."

[John F. Kennedy] "The moon and the planets are there.
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.
And therefore as we set sail; we ask God's blessing -
on the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure
of which man has ever embarked."

"Prepared for liftoff."

[Guru]
I Self Lord And Master, shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

[Chorus: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
Humungous effect in the world - we could have conquered it

[Chorus x2]
[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
The nigga had a pair of Air Olden Polynice's on
Oh shit, the nigga had a pair of Air Christen Slaters
Rebel I, slay the max, it's really Digital
Rockin' the latest in, every day comin' at niggaz
Rockin' the latest in Ben Stillaways
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggaz
Now that's a money thing
Yo yo

[Hook: Inspectah Deck - singing]
I was +Dashing+ through the hood
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh, smokin' all the way
Hahaha!
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine
Yo son we gotta make that +CREAM+ whether raps or Nixon times

[Inspectah Deck]
They call me Rollie, watch me polly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti
Snatch the +CREAM+, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread
then call myself Collar Ratsi
Professionally trained, I am for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys
Spark the brocolli, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse
Seen..

[Chorus x4: Inspectah Deck]
Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

[GZA]
They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five

[Chorus x4]
[RZA] Yo... check check it
[Tekitha] You can never defeat
[RZA] Yo check the method of this shit right here one time
[Tekitha] The Gods
[RZA] Sparkin your braincells to the upmost
[Tekitha] Impossible
[RZA] Unlimited epidemics bein spreaded
[Tekitha] You can never defeat
[RZA] You know, we try and add on for y'all niggas
[Tekitha] The Gods
[RZA] Yo, yo

[Verse One: RZA]

Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, livin irrelevant
The most benelovent king, communicatin through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
everywhere, throughout your surroundin atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenemants
Eighty-Five percent tenants depend on welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye is bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated
Blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testin poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the innauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
like Bartholemew, cause every particle is physical article
was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A space night like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron

[Verse Two: U-God]

United Nations, gun fire style patient
Formulatin rap plural acapella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free in escape of sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
the whole Babylon, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
opposed through the gate, case closed
Things get froze, when it comes time, chosen ones
were holding guns, we take flight with no fright
and attack, never fear cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone Son, we can't care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the rightous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black hope, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlastin answers stay flyin over Egypt

[Chorus: Tekitha]

For you to defeat, the Gods
Impossible, you can never... defeat
The Gods, impossible
For you to defeat, the Gods

[Verse Three: Ghostface Killah]

Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kemit
Don't go Son, nigga you my motherfuckin heart
Stay still Son, don't move, just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January, your young God needs you
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me bitch, gimme your jack
One, seven one eight, nine one one, low battery, damn
Blood comin out his mouth, he bleedin badly
Nahhh Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In Sixty-Nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one, oh shit, here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on, screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin, Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, dirty tarts are tellin
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yohoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten

[Outro: Raekwon and Tekitha]

Now what my man is trying to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe (you can never)
The murder rates is increasin, and we decreasin (you can never)
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns Son (you can never defeat)
That causes the conflict of you goin against your own (the Gods)
You hear me, so let's pay attention
Straight up and down, cause this is only a story
From the real
[Cappadonna:]
Yo! It's the burial ground sound, Dunn!
It's real out here
Staten Island puttin chills in y'all niggaz
Forever in it.. yo

My devastatin hot '97 Mentality
Keep me on point for my four-digit salary
Heavyweight lyric never lost one calorie
I'm soon to be seen, on the TV screen
Gambino Cappacino to the Afro Sheen
Stay black, where I'm at, high road to rap council
Splash love to Wu in a orderly tonsil
Never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Through the damage to the wannabe Flipmode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
My word of mouth it's all real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage
Twenty-four diamond government named God
Alias Daryl Hill bring thugs back to kill
Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin large
Auntie Dauntie sixteen holdin me down
AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromisin
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggaz not keepin it real
Dirtball niggaz that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggaz I be wantin on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats and my man keep em bustin till he's gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
'Donna come through everyday my uniform
changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggaz get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack kid
Watch how the slang hits you, just like the fat kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
on a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean?

[Ghostface:]
To the year Born God all the Gods strike hard
Fast from the swine hold down your boulevard
Father-U to C-Cypher, start the revolution
Middle finger in the air, for slang prostitution
[x2]

To the year Born God all the Gods strike hard
Fast from the swine hold down your boulevard
Father-U to C-Cypher, start the revolution
Middle finger in the air, for slang prostitution

To the year Born God all the Gods strike hard
Fast from the swine hold down your boulevard
Father-U to C-Cypher, start the revolution
Middle finger in the air, for slang prostitution

To the year, to the year Born God all the Gods strike hard
Fast from the swine hold down your boulevard
Father-U to C-Cypher, start the revolution
Middle finger in the air, for slang prostitution
[Chorus: (sampled)]

After laughter, comes tears

[Verse One: The RZA]

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh HA
Not knowin, exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
"Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough"
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "No!!"
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin, the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was...
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's alway the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killer]

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin out
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

[Chorus X2]
[Redman]
Yo, yo
Yeah, come on

Yeah no doubt who gots the biggest ass in the house

Salt water trout, pretty young thing
Got a tongue ring and dirty mouth

Until she got high and went and fucked Potsi
Lady Godiva
From day one a dick rider
Liar, liar set your pussy on fire

[Redman] [(Method Man)]
Yo Doc be off the wall

Pulling a Harley deep with a jar of grease
Come 1-5-1, straight endo, the spot

Its Doc not guns don't sling weight
The only thing I sling is condoms for spring break
(Fuck 'em) How we do it?
(Leave 'em) How we do it?
(Get the money) The pussy
(The weed) Now do it

[Method Man] [(Redman)]
Now take your coat off and stay a while
Now honey child if you're gon' be acting funny style

Shit is popping, Acheeva my mouth cotton
Tis the season for draws dropping
And heavy breathing
You ain't skeezin' you dick teasin'

And watch it smoke
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

We are gonna take it to a new level in hip-hop

[Chorus - ODB]
Wu gots like come on through, Sooooh is the call for the Wu

[Buddha Monk]
They call me heatmizer
Blowing my top your not wiser
The lyrical robber
I burn ya ass like Lava
Magma
Plus you can bust my crust
They call me road runner I leave ya ass in the dust
I drink the heat beneath the Earth's core
6 Million and 50 degrees maybe more
Over ground mounds, metallic minerals, enough flesh
Leaving mother fuckers in a mess
Myyyy crustal plate, you cant separate my colossal force
BLAST!! your off course
Drying molting rock, I can flow nonstop
Condense with sea water watch me spin like a top
For miles and miles deep
You cant endure the heat
Be the first to run or the last nigga sleep
I sore with the glasses, Thick like molasses
Now I breath exhale the poison gases

[Chorus]

[Drunken Dragon]
Now take this
I hit you with the drunken dragon fist
Got the funk for you mind leaving niggas in bliss
I look deep in your eyes, digging into your soul
Pulling out the inner thoughts, weak minds behold
I know exactly what your thinking
Wait for you to blink and hit you with a rhyme and make your ego sinking
I send your wack ass back to class, learn something
So you can peep the real shit and you can stop fronting
On your phony block, with your phony glock
And so you slip, when niggas burn the drama they put text on your lips
Booka Blaww! Son I just about thought of that shit
So you want to be a gansta rapper boy you get the dick
The drunken dragon coming at you
If I hear you say Brooklyn Zu then I say who you!

[Chorus]

[ODB]
Now back the fuck up before I use my gat
Spray two to your neck, and four to your back
Its the hard-core warrior straight from Madena
Look upon my face it shows no ameba
Brooklyn Zu, Killa bees on the swarm
I bee in your area so sound the alarm
Monks in the front, not the fucking trunk
Knocking down niggas, and girls see the lump
Shit is real, yes im hitting hot like spiel
Im coming through your town, so its best that your peel
For real
Yes I get dirty with my skills
No slacks in my thoughts no time for me (cough)
Niggas your crazy I leave no fucking traces
When I leave it on your ass you be desinergrated
Crazy lunatic, with the style thats sick
Somebody in my click is bound to set up it, ya hit
By the strikes shit that I fist, Im just like the devil I dont play no tricks

[Chorus]

[Verse 1:]
I used to kick my new rhymes to him when I made them up
We'd smoke a blunt, and build on shit was real growing up
Going through the same things, we seeing eye to eye
And no matter what happens, promised to let nothing die
So was born when he got bagged for 56 dimes
I'mma give his girl commissary money all the time
He caught this disease and couldn't stay out'ta jail
Locked up when his mom died, shit really got real
He came to the wake in handcuffs
Dear God, Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
His girl eight months pregnant, a nurse assistant holding him down
Faithfully on every visit, food packages, she bring him trees and
everything
A down ass bitch is a thug's everything
I'm day he night, we the same blood type, brothers for life
I fly him kites on the regular

[Chorus:]
When you come home, we gon' blow crazy O's son (Don't stress)
When you come home, we gon' fuck mad hoes son (Don't stress)
When you come home, I'mma put you on your toes on (Don't stress)

When you come home, we gon' blow crazy O's son (Don't stress)

[Verse 2:]

Jump in the V2G
You finally free
Long time no see
Gotta make up for lost time

Here, rock my shine
We on to the exclusive, new shit
He blowing up my celly
I'm like yo son, six minute click
Pulled up to the PJ's, the hood greet
Welcome home god peace,
He platinum on the street with respect and power
All he need is currency
Must report to parole
Monday by three
We gon' get you on the books and take you on tour with me
No stress, nigga you can use my address
He said I love you Shy and punched me in my chest

[Chorus: x2]
When you come home, we gon' blow crazy L's son (Don't stress)
When you come home, I'mma put you on your toes on (Don't stress)
When you come home, we gon' fuck mad hoes son (Don't stress)
When you come home, my nigga, when you come home (Don't stress)

[Verse 3:]
Give a kidney or a lung to nigga if he needed one
Cause that's my Dunn Dunn
I give him my only gun if he needed it
Oh that bitch, we both beating it
I can tell him a secret, he ain't repeating it
Cause that's my dog, second grade to the morgue
And when I get locked up, that who the fuck I call
He the cheddy ready to pay the clerk, to get me out the dirt
Put it in my aunt's name, because she work
We don't jerk one another, or try to blow each other's cover
My mother's like his mother, his mother's like my mother
No one on ones; I'm jumpin' in
Fuck that, blazing out the club with our guns back to back
Chicago Bulls style, the manchild
Ain't nothing sweet on the street
Or if you hit the pen-AL you know my style

When you come home, we gon' blow crazy L's son (Don't stress)
When you come home, I'mma put you on your toes on (Don't stress)
When you come home, we gon' fuck mad hoes son (Don't stress)
When you come home, my nigga, when you come home (Don't stress)
When you come home, we gon' blow crazy O's son (Don't stress)
When you come home, we gon' fuck mad hoes son (Don't stress)
When you come home, I'mma put you on your toes on (Don't stress)
When you come home, my nigga, when you come home (Don't stress)

Yeah, Shyheim...
New York's Finest
[U-God]
Yo, rated x, smack you off the stage when I'm vexed
No sweat, I crack a cold case of Beck's
Guess whose back, the jack of all trades is next
The rap cuisine, I crack a raw egg and flex
I cave in your chest, this one came from the jets
Yeah, the cause and effect, make innocent blood pour
The streets is like the rap game, a daily tug of war
For rich or for poor, or death do us part, niggaz come for test

[Chorus: U-God]
Still grimey (grimey, grimey)
Still slimey (slimey, slimey)
Don't try me (try me, try me)
It's been ten long years, you can't untie me

[Sean Price]
Bring fire and Ruck let the heat pour
Niggaz like Ruck 'Fuck you rhyming to this beat for?'
Listen, life is like a muthafuckin' seesaw
One minute you're hot, the next, your rep drops
None of your biz, fuck around, and run in your crib
Wife like 'He ain't here', throw some to your wiz
Niggaz running up on me, til the tre' pound click
Talking 'bout 'Ruck, let's battle' on some 8 Mile shit
I'm like; nigga, my name ain't B. Rabbit
It's Sean Price, Big Ruckus from busting these ratchets
Call me gay basher, for fucking up these faggots
Ya'll niggaz ain't nothing, stop fronting, stay passive
Yo, pass the dutch, on the left hand side
Sean gone til November, stole Wyclef's ride
Bob Backlund, car jacking, New Jersey driving
Ya'll niggaz ain't think about rapping, til you hear me rhyming, oh

[Chorus]

[Prodigal Sunn]
I keeps it real in the field, Navy feel on the drill
Never stingy with my bills, plenty gravy I spilled
Recorded in the history of rap, two inch reels
Seven to ten mills, eleven to twenty hills
Rest in peace to my brother Half-A-Mil
Unnecessary blood spilt, another thug killed
Move with the mass appeal, the blast still
For the Cash Money Click, No Limits and no thrills
Mad cuz your hoe, feeling P. Sunzini, give you
As sweet as a kiwi, face it, you not me, nigga
Ladi dadi, the Gods like to party
We don't cause trouble, but we can make you a body
Ladi dadi, the Sunn likes to party
I don't cause trouble, but I will make you a body
Flowin' high in the Mazarati, two with my ninjas beside me
Lively, floating on some Ducatti's
With two gellati's, two hotties, we never sloppy
Jewelry rocky, Spanish pieces, they call me papi
Clear fire Bacardi, sobered up like Gotti
Rest in peace to my dog, Shotti, Shotti

[Chorus]

[C-Rayz Walz]
On the corner ready to bo', holding my nuts
Standing by my building looking at myself in the truck
My reflections... (still grimey)
Oscar the Grouch's worms (still slimey)
I got a jones for Miss Piggy's ham hiney
I can be a bum in the slums, and slam shiny
On every corner, I'm grams, you can find me
The boss of the burners, I fire shots if your nine speak
This is true Manchu, and who you, fams too?
Better have they face in the game, like the Blue Man Group
I heard you smell me, I make it funky
Rock hard and kick ass like, I hate you donkeys
My oatmeal lumpy like Johnson's Bumpy, Harlem humpty
Hungry wolves, pain's hummer, harbor hungry
Dumpty, blazing trees, now leave an O.E. present
Know why the hood feel me, like police presence

[Chorus]
[glasses/jewelry tinkling]
You my Daddy whore [2X]
[laughing]
[Cappa] Whoever she gonna do anyway
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it
Who else, who else is gonna...

[Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard]

This is dedicated to all you bitches
Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ass
Candy-ass, blew my hole in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you shoulda seen her
She had a babyface creamer Purinas
Called up talkin Tina
I put my dick in a broom
She blew my head like a balloon
I had her walkin on the moon

[Verse Two: Cappadonna]

Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin your time
Oh you shine, I'm lookin at your ass from behind
You walked by smellin like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin
My nuts start yellin, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy
After that we can cheat, laid on the bed
Handcuffed with hard meat, long stroke smackin
Smack it then broke, nothin can't stop my
continous poke, compound
Porno flick music, Daddy came with it when I wrote it

[Verse Three: Ol Dirty Bastard]

Dirt Dog be bouncin on bitches like fog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty
I like it muddy or swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fuckin room me and my momma and my TV
Blackberry squeeze
Bitch who a tease, titties small, I got used to the squeaks
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these
welfare cheese, now to blow fifty G's
overseas, I'm doin the breeze, in my 850

[Verse Four: RZA]

Suicidal, she been in more hotels than bibles
Idle worshippin bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot
but had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy fucked for movie and a loose leaf
cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons
Big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggaz sinnin against their women
and enjoyed, to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
and shameless, her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her namelist
Her obsession, caused niggaz to get, the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em
Wanted niggaz to fuck her raw dog without no condom

[woman moans] oooooh, ahahhh, ohh

[Wu-Tang movie samples]
You people are all trying to acheive the impossible
That's exactly what we've done
But you'll fail, and you'll all die
If we die, the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them, for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed
[Chorus x2]
Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indespensible
We never fall
We stand tall like sky-scrapers and justice for all

[Killa Sin]
We move on MC's mechanically
Strike nerves like Ghost's verse on 'Can It Be'
hard to touch retarded fucks playing wit they fantasies
respect this, specialist, black
testing this will get ya necklace jacked
and named scratched up off my guestlist party freak
You the type of nigga that'll hardly speak unless you spoken to
You throw a cold screw, but sober up when I'm approaching you
At the same time we posting two
Niggas on that ass that's gonna do what they supposed to do
The limelight, snatched away from you because it's my night
Killarm blaze inside of the twilight, you better get ya lines right
Half of these crabs cant even rhyme right
with dust flows, robotic movement, and blurry eyesights
What you want I already got
and that's control, I keep my head high, hand pon cock
and pockets swollen, you foldin, you faggot ass fuck

[Dom Pachino]
Yo farotion never fails
shoot at darts sharper than a carpenters nail
inhale life, exhale strive anxiety's trife
blowin' smoke out my peace pipe
Ducking the snipe
shot off the top of the White House and cop 4'S
war never does and many causes
my offense is my defense extreme precautious
moving cyphers high valocities making you nautious
ya forcing it
parishly extortionists
aborting this
space ship thats spacious face it
im on contain shit
pioneer looking for honey and is it matrix
the case is
if not ya basic
way to make shit
embrace it
knowing some day you'll have to face it

[Chorus]
Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indespensible
We never fall
We stand tall like sky-scrapers and justice for all
(so fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas)

[Bobby Digital]
yo, yo hard to grapple
I raise the sharp scaple
technique slaps you invasion body snatch you money grip
I smoke the honey dip blunts cherry bomb very calm
First bursts like a shot from the Berry homes
you'd be most wise to pay close attention
to willy lynchin'
its stupid to fuck wit' Bobby Steel's henchmen
I step into presidential
credentials, evident my potential
be infinate, deluxe benetic sluts invinsible
only ones can know me
swore me before the Dolby
Alexis Colby broads try to control me
pussy whip me like Toby
fuck the local
I move global
economical
ship sea promise fool
my info glow
and the dark Wu-Tang logo
sparks the attention, look listen observe
killa bee swerv
slam like Dr. Julias Erv
still strike the vital nerve
charter through the Magna Carta
trapped like Otis and Carter
wild like a Shaolin child from Mariners Harbor
king devine forced to shine
head burst open like a bottle of Pine
use penmenship
when I write my script
blunt spark em' and them mark em' homeless
Killa Hill syndrome
peace to Two Tone
he must know me to understand me from what you do
to realize I'm you
everything I do honey bee from the bee hive
Ever-green squeeze dried leaf smoke Killa Priest from the tribe
of Levi smoke out and not steal
or blunt spill
the indestructable Bobby Steel's is here

[Method Man]
Yo In The Heat of The Night
my 4-7-7 mash on the mic
Killarmy and Trappa John M.D.
full metal jackets
cuz' some gots to have it
kill or be killed
only time will reveal
I think by myself
and I drink by myself
from 9-8 until
let me know its real son if its really real
understandable
self explainable
caution John Blaze flamable
when under pressure, interchangable and still
coming down like precipitation as I reign undesputed
how Johnny do it
dangerously, whoppin cough (cough, cough)
two and off
stank pussy make my dick soft (huh)
bottom line be this high, explosive
not for the average Joseph
come and get some
hol' it, keep one
up in the chamber
blast wit' my middle finger
now I toss men
attack like the Four Horsemen
see me dog walkin'
strickly getty-o slang talkin'
all up in thease guts, soften
thease rap niggas, official
we slap niggas
wit' mak' charges
dope shit regardless
we usually take another niggas garments (what)

[Killarmy]
Straight up and down I got this rap shit locked in '98
niggas cant escape the laws that I enforce like top notch politicians
who be pola-tickin'
slam through expand total construction accross the planet and micro chip software
placed in the rear of ya ear
as I sit the next year
all yall analong niggas fuck yall we be digital
shit is critical
like the hallways in my projects
similar to the streets in Tibet
fuck that I aint playin' wit' a full deck (son, son, son, son)
[repeated in background throughout entire track] "He loves us"

[Chorus: Anne Peebles - sampled]
If you're not gonna take care of business stop takin up space
If you're not gonna take care of business stop takin up space

[Lord Superb:]
Eh-yo, it's Perb dunn
Wu, A.C.T., Chip Banks, Rakeem Allah
Come on! Projects, projects
Slums, bums, ghettoes
Large sums, yo

We read it all in the fan magazine
Hookers, pushers, lead magazine
I grew up in Queens around Pappy and 'Preme
Have my own dreams, cop a Caddy and lean
And Drag told me about the fans in rap
And after that talk all we said was that
I'ma keep pushin the trigger 'til ya head is back
Get rich off my songs, the hell with crack
And Jamel ran through every jail with raps
Tryin to push my voice on every reel and track
And I don't give a fuck if the reel is wack
I bring an old school MC feelin back
And we still in the hood with gats
And my goons ain't good with gats
And where you think you goin with the wooden plaques?
See, it ain't just me, the whole Wu is back
But you don't know what to do with tracks
And what can this industry do with trash?
And what the fuck you gon' do for rap?
I'ma do it for the kids, get a school, some cash
Fuck a chain, I'm jewel they ass
Like why play if the game don't last?

[Chorus x2]

[Solomon Childs:]
Yeah...
My vultures are signed and blinded by money getters
Players and pimps, ya ho chose me
Supposedly, that's how the game go
And ain't a difference in prison gats and ghetto walls
That's why we playin hard ball
This be perfections from my father's hustle
Shrimp and bustles and life's complicated puzzles
Grew up under the Older Gods, sits there with Cee Allah
Came from the same thug parts and drug parts as Tony Stark
I understand that the industry be under-handed
Underground and under-lined
Thank God, word, it took me so long to get signed
Climb out of a hell of a bind
That's why I still return around the way
Throw a toast to ya nose and ask what's mine
Forward my emotions of a supreme rap artist
Solomon Childs, New York protege
I've now been discovered
Adjusted, it was all in my kin, got me smothered
Wu-Tang for life, my brothers got me covered
Millionaire, billionaire status
Beef with police like Marshall and Onasis
Dealin wit uniqueness

[Chorus x2]
(Come on in)
[Ol Dirty singing]
Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn
(come on in)
Dinn-dnn-ta-dnn, dinn DNN DAH
(come on, come on, come on in)
Dnn-da-duh-duh-DAH, you BITCH ASS niggaz!
(come on in, come on, come on, come on in)

[Intro/Chorus: Ol Dirty/Osirus]

As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!

[Verse One: The Genius/GZA]

Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
it was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
to analytical analogy, insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggaz I see starvin
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
A fugitive bass playin rap czar
smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Method Man/Iron Lung]

Tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly
what the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin
the ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
prone to drops ya, slash ya, rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched, John John
bring the phenomenon, I cold crush
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
as we move on, saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo I-N-S another code red, danger, break out the vest
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
Don't ever roam, in the naked city
Eight Fingers stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable, conditionin be critical
Peace to Tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
is a toast to your memory
When I go how many niggaz gon' remember me

[Chorus]
[Intro: RZA]
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it
Get it, get it, get it, get it,
And so as Bobby...
And so as Bobby...
And so as Bobby start to learn more jewels of life
He became more the wiser, and the RZA was being manifested from within
For a new embryo, had been born through the cypher
Bringin' forth into existence, the Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
And he started to spit shit like this

[RZA:]
Yo, Happy New Year, throw on your Wu-Wear
We true here, you crab derelict bastards, you can't push through here
The ice melter, you best to to dive for ya shelter
This a sign, when it's called Alpha Phi Sigma Phi Delta
Digi tech, 36 tech, eject pelet
Rip through rap cadet, no one left to tell it
Then them hook, walked through justice in Brooks
Scotch whiskey, in the middle of Patty, with four glocks wit me
Hand pull trigger nigga, 16-shot dart spitta
Chart splittas, who walk through the hood, heart bitter
For industriliazed rapped capatilist, trynna snatch a crack of this
BZA bitch, please don't make me flip, flip, flip, flip

And bones get sparked, my wiz as strong as Joan of Arc

While ya dogs just bark, bark, bark
We spread this attitude, to every point of latitude
Every street crevest, every quarter, every avenue
I might be on the Iffel, wit a 30/30 scope riffler
Ready to snipe you, and wipe you from the face of the earth
You can taste it diverse, the blood thirst
I start to bring the great Flood, first, first, first

[Outro: RZA]
So as his mind start to grow
He start expression himself through his hip hop culture
Changin' his thoughts, standin' on his truth of square

Build it better himself to those around him
And he start talkin like this...
Hungry men have no respect for law or authority
Or human life, a man's bread and butter is only
insured if he works for it
Leadership means everything, pain, blood and death
What night is to day, man is to woman
And woman is to man, fear is the state of nervousness
Only fit for children, not men
All men are created equal, so to offend man, is to offend God
Fear is lose control of one third, if you become like a helpless deer
Or a feathless bird, we stand as the true of living, living true
And these jewels, thoughts of great wise men, like Marcus Garvey
Start to build up inside Bobby's head
And it lead him to the knowledge of himself
And he became a strong muthafucka!
[Raekwon chattin with Shy]
"Peace God"
"Peace to the Gods"
"How you God?"
"Studyin one-twenty right now"
"Mmmm"
"Call me back at the God Hour"

[Raekwon the Chef]
The Fuck?
It's just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow...
That's how we doin it

Bound by honest sword take over the set; rap from here to Que-bec
Throw up the tech, crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggaz fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Askin my man'll get you slapped down; play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who rip it?

[God] Projects
[Rae] My niggaz survive, just like a movin target
[God] Projects
[Rae] Where niggaz live and some sell garbage that's
[God] Projects
[Rae] Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
[God] New York projects
[Rae] I'm livin large yo, stop miragin

[Method Man]
Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is tech-9
Blast at any Close Encounter of the Third Kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle, any adversary
Them niggaz all thumbs and can't handle, my flurry
Hear me, you jam all you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coke aimin at cha kidney
Pressure, Red Hot like Chili Pepper

TALKIN TO YOU DADDY, fart's breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar, to try to tighten up your ginger

Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house

Slanging sugar delite

Sometimes a turf is like a war zone
Or even Vietnam, not at the movies but you still see the died come
And a nigga catch a slug, caps' be pulled for fun foo
You got to watch your shit before we pull a ak on your own blood
Se niggaz will stick you for your cash
That's when they enter the t-shirt contest to super soak their ass
So Method Man show these niggaz the deal

[Method Man:]
Who dat nigga? You on with me with the super fly Methtical nigga

With the guns blazing? You trail, my god, its amazing

Nightmares like Wes Craven
The bigger the critter, the harder to pull the trigga
I'll send your ass back to the dark side nigga
Your a snake, I've seen you sliver, so I deliver with death
We'll throw your punk ass in the river
On the battle ship

Beat that ass bloody as I send it to the camp. Tical!

[Chorus:]

Got these niggaz screaming out paws
Pistol grip and breaking out their jaw

Many niggaz out there to go nuts with me
And even on your block smoke them like a fucked up bell
Cant be caught by no Po-Po's cant be put in no slammer

Aint no body going to tell, leave your dick in the dirt
And yo momma as well

Capping your ass for the 94, what you know? Grab your glock
Blah! Me burst out first 'Mon
We Audi 7000 G
[GZA (RZA)]
I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock
The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop
A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks
With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
And each link in your chain is trucked
No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers
Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper
I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's
Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs
It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
Now his wigs pushed back
Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact
(Yo)

[Chorus x2: U-God]
Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+
Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+

[Method Man]
MC's have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta
It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya
Like red heat with hammers and sickles
I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues
It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us
Then lord strike me down where I stand at now
wit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen
The most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC
Of course it's Tical!

[Chorus]

[U-God]
The Princess, the Pope, incest, dope
Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke
The man not for joke, we all out for broke
Plus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote
You can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton
I'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one
I stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome
+Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch
Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs
Sick winter gear, been on position is where
Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+
Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
Swing through the hood calmly
Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George
Dust shut shit off, whips spin off
Get off, slips, which, wiz
Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines
Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies
Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine
Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines

[Chorus]
Yo, yeah bitch
Aiyyo, motherfucker
Aiyyo, swallow it

Aiyyo we dazzle off this bloody version of 'Glaciers'
Slang shot threw a gem in his mouth, swallowed his razor (wsssht)
Say no more, my back be parked against the wall
Trooper square holding, 'Face don't give a fuck about the law
Take off the bracelets, don't get blinded by the ice Boo
It's not cool, Veronica slept, plus the decimal
Look at my jumper logo look familiar? It's Power (Where is he?)
Yo every fine snitch knocks an inch off Eddie Bauer
Gucci sneaker rockin just another form of 'Chessboxin'
No cock-blockin, supreme clientele, till I'm droppin
Kangol slanted, Ghost'll ran with it, hippie hung-out
Club bandit never empty-handed when I brand it
Mark callin Austin, Mark callin Austin down in Boston
Both of them dead, cop in the loft and
big chain swingin nigga, Matchbox car drivin
Street whylin, Role' with the four-finger glidin
Watch him, scorchin with spells and top toxin
Amoxins til the stock skyrocket, Bobby Mocassin
Switched from Pert Plus, escrow on the side throw in sun trust
Ghost'll keep shinin til the sun bust
yo word up, born-to-be right behind the curtain with her nose out
Sixty center get the Rover out
Featherhead heathens, teethin on mic dicks
When thy said, "Let the kids die for your bread nigga!"

Yo, promoters don't want us in clubs because we spaz out
'Who is these righteous motherfuckers with they flags out?'
Stapleton Projects, recognize you're lookin at
Allah's best, puttin on the hits is no contest
NOW, who the hypest in New York City?
WU-TANG!  Radio stop shittin on me!

[Superfly]
"I got fifty men out in the street
Now if they all get bitch troubles I starve
Is that it?  Is that what you're tryin to tell me?"

Aiyyo, the moccasin money, one man behind the plate
Hold it down honey-shallah rock the half man Gumby
Twisted, the mime of the floods, niggaz spell drama
one oh five point six llama
Cosmetic classical, slum is shield, Milagro Beanfield
Watch me inhale half of you, new attributes
Teletronics, DBX, one sixty X
Compression with the A and sharp press
Extract bass in which the gooey dew drips, vanilla suckle
with jasmine bits, five hundred rap battin average
One taste the bowl and blow up magic, Houdini escapes
from the fermenting hell halls of tragic
Speaking to the First of April's, deep in the rap game
Erasial, Excedrin head bredderns catch facials
Side orders, one telephone for take out
Stomp your man half to death rob him then we break it
Get off on the ?Clove? Exit, knees dirty, chick now
with low leverage, watch it how she lick the head of me
Cause it's law, order today, we pay dues
New Tomorrow's, Rubik's Cube money in a tube
Deck the Halls, crush salary dice that's in ? hall
Hey y'all Peppermint Pattie's, slum my Peter Paul
Wrangler, straight laid the track when it's sag
with one banger, interlude loop caused me to hang up
Ticklish, Crunchberry niggaz at the flicks pissed off
Standin in the rain and can't find they whips
Suckers! Motherfucker! Yo

Yo, promoters don't want us in clubs because we spaz out
'Who is these righteous motherfuckers with they flags out?'
Stapleton Projects, recognize you're lookin at
Allah's best, puttin on the hits is no contest
NOW, who the hypest in New York City?
WU-TANG!  Radio stop shittin on me
[Raekwon the Chef]
Scrape y'all motherfuckers
This is my word, when you see us
When you see us flashing and shining
And building and adding on
Y'all niggaz just watch it, hear me
Only ones that who we got respect for
Is them niggaz that we say peace to
Hear me, pay attention, put your shoes on
Yo, my team be bellyaching hungry niggaz on the swarm again
Pirahna niggaz bite dick, yo Son, it's on again
What up, he made a move, try to assist it
Listen kid yo, you was born to be a pawn but I'm a bishop
Back to the novel, you Son, it's logical
How you figure God, what, flow on the track, flip the obstacle
Now my proposal, it's the global
From California to courts, it's over God, so taste the tofu
Remember baggy jeans, the Timberlands in November
Shorty called me Santa in December
But guess what, my Wally's got messed up
Autograph presser what, blast enough to blow your rest up
We scrape that, Land O' Lake that
My dolo rapper get you sent back
Represent the gentlemens who bent that
Flash medallions like Italians
La costra nostra, we moving through your hood like a poster
Flex this, Lex and Diamonds hold the settlement
So keep the bust the gun Boo
Like that bad ass bitch in Dead Presidents
Add on, the billboard sloan
Check it now, you get the gold dick award
It's like jail and it's the sixth floor
Test me, floating in the S.E., now let's see
Half of y'all niggaz built your rhyme from my sess tree
Faggots, homos, yo, my flavor liver than a dobo
Stay militant kid, push it like bolo
You fucking idiot, playing with my Clan but you be fearing it
Face one, I'm guaranteed to make you take one
Please, y'all niggaz money getting low
But did you come back, set up shop, and get the phat dough
Tired of y'all, mostly inspired by y'all
So what the deal now, blinking with us or put your shield down
Faggot, fuck fuck around punk, battle for cream nigga

[RZA]
You want to pound crab, nah let his hand swing
I ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings
No more said, knew your chump ass was dead
When I saw the four four reflecting off your shiny forehead
It's Wu-Tang nigga, ain't nothing changed nigga
Still shame on a nigga, who tried to run game
Get virgin and perversions, fucking bitches with Persian
Bugs watching niggaz like the turgeon, it's the surgeon slugs
still pounds when Bobby Steels 12 gauge gonna pay deadly chronicles
We, held up in Gotham take heed and protect your seeds
We fall like all the leaves, who lack tranquility
In your rap utility to fuck with the abilities
Raised like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone
Age of poems and poetry, old sloans
Explosive head bullets, black hooded
Invalid footed ninjas, who full metal jacket clips
And know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise
For no purchase price, I'm certainly a heist
For your ice and curtains and vice
Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me, diary...
I need 18 points for my next joint
This high and mointed king, to make a deal
I be the one to appoint, Steve Ripken must have been sniffing
To catch something so dope, it left minor c-lits pussy dripping
I fuck hundreds of bitches, and split millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hildred of horor
Legal kid brown in Nicaragua
Gave birth to MC's, seeds and bank robbers
We drove with pistol whips into world-wide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Stand to tell the contestants, in the world's best repressment
But none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
Or my queen and my seeds, in the home that I rest in
Enter my dome get blown to 99 sections

[Method Man]
This rhyme has no limitations, this time there's no hesitation
Collecting minds at the door, you want it niggaz it's yours
The flavors raw, what the fuck you think I'm flowing for
It's rhyme and reason, bite the bullet
Niggaz is foul in this duck season
We add odds till we even motherfucker
Bad asses, high times, lower classes
Taste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to him, room service, under pressure
And mad nervous, waving guns at the clergy
Ticallion, we ain't worried
Keep them sick niggaz seven-thirty
Picture this, watch the birdy
This bastards is rolling dirty
With sharp pins that be stabbing you
Pins and needles, needles and pins
Nuff said, dick in your mouth
Like pimp was bled, as I race track with thoroughbreds
Ducking the feds

[Raekwon the Chef]
Yo, my ice slow fly up on the keyboard son
Niggaz ran up on me law, praising what we do by the lords
That's right, exile the fake, hit them niggaz like weight
Feed a fool, let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction, that's the whole science of mine
Production, ya'll niggas guess who stuck son
Left his meth son, switch, finger itch
Staring at you like a bitch, maybe y'all niggaz snitch
Youse a loner, Adidas shell top with lye
sipping Corona, read the rev report then bone her
Buy you some jewels, here's some food
Not neccessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo
We in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom
Baggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs
Chill, y'all niggaz know what time it is
James Bond Beamers behind me, on Bacardi Lime and
check out the pitch like Nolan Ryan
He cought a slug for lying
Yeah you was lying, where's the cash, crying
Militia, rolling in position
Casa Blanca Cuban Link Christian
Lex the tally back whistling, fake fucks
[Chorus: sampled singer (Inpsectah Deck)]
One of these days and you wont be long (It wont be long now)
One of these days and you wont be long (You bound to come up)
One of these days and you wont be long (Keep your eyes on us)
One of these days and you wont be long (Yeah, yeah, yeah, Deck)

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flyin' fuck
Talk with signs up, walk with the iron tucked
Leave your eyes wide shut
Money bag's on +The Table+, gots to get locked up
Rebel I's simply slicker, pick up a pretty sister
Dig her out on +The Table+, bend off the remy licker
Head splitter, deliver so cold I send shivers
From many figures, battle the world or any nigga
I'm Uptown +Saturday Nite+ like Bill Carr's
Got weed in the jars with vanilla cigars
On the strip, eyeballin' the chicks, holdin' the mix
Blast off of my shit, vibratin' the whip

[Chorus: sampled singer (Raekwon)]
One of these days and you wont be long (That's what you call it pa)
One of these days and you wont be long (Chef!)

[Raekwon]
Yo I'm sicker than the V12 [X5]
With cracks in the Rolly jumper all we do is Drink fuckin' Drive
Real niggas raise up, Mommy get your feet off +The Table+
The cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
It's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
Blow off them matches and sit up with you
Aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
Stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
Slingin' coke is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
Straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
Yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
If we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
Take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
Rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
Nines crowns verses your nine towns
Run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down

[Chorus: sampled singer {U-God} (Raekwon)]
One of these days and you wont be long {Yo} (That's what you call it pa)
One of these days and you wont be long {Yo, yo}

[U-God]
I come from the slums, I ain't no dummy
My testiment talk, represent money
This +Verbal Intercourse+, fueled by exhaust
The bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
No remorse, endorse the rap artist
So flamboyant cos I pimp slap the hardest
Ever since the +Triumph+ we've been missin' them soldiers
We came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
Bulldose through the rubbish, I'm in too deep boy
I just gotta love this, they call we Too Sweet
One of the nine brothers, I'm so unique
Every line that smother, the situation's grim
It's bloody sin cos every time I want out they pull me back in
I see my reflection in the chrome mack 10
Ask the passer who's faster with the pen
Then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
That's how I like it, sweat on my wine bottles
The automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
The endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
Veteran smile, +Dat's Gangsta+ shit, that American style
Dig it, prick or prey
I'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga

"I got to know"

[Chorus x4: sampled singer (Raekwon)]
One of these days and you wont be long (That's what you call it pa)
One of these days and you wont be long

"I got to know"
[Intro: Ghostface Killah (RZA) {Method Man}]

You get me everything? (I got you a cheese joint)
{Diamond buscuits, mothafucka!}

[Break: Method Man (RZA) {Prodical}]
Now let's see, we don't get down like that
See, he holds his own, haha, he holds his own
Haha, he holds his own (Bank!)
(John Blizzy) {Straight like that}
He holdin' twenty on this
(Ghost Deini) {Uh-huh! Yeah!}
(ShaCronz) {The invincible, baby)
Bad boys (Suga Bang) {It's like that!}
(D-Digi!)

[Method Man (Prodical):]
Spontaneous combustion got niggaz lustin'
Fuckin' with this head bustin' track spanker
Decaffinator, crab sinker, twenty-five
Tryin' to live to see my forty acher, before I die
Immaculate conceptions like loaded weapons
Shootin' up ya rap session in mere seconds (Bluh! Bluh!)
Ya whole style is undressin'
Try to hide yaself behind the R&B section
And got spotted, fuckin' with them fake artists who make garbage
Now ya like a human target with no direction
And no protection, rap nigga assed out and no question
Dead and buried, we holdin' like the military
Fuck Dog Shit, hide-out beats and hot cherries
On virgin mic's, style very cri-Tical
By any means necessary, mad lyr-ical
The Ghostrider, want vengeance on you style biters
Ya whole sect got you gassed 'til I sparked the lighter
And burnt that ass like Dhalsim in Street Fighter
I play the shadows, scopin' out you lime lighters and Desperados

[Chorus: Suga Bang Bang (RZA) {Prodical}]
Killa Beez is ridin' East to West, baby
See our twenties spinnin' on our trucks, baby
Diamonds, Cubans hangin' from our neck, baby
Come on, come on

[Interlude: RZA {Prodical}]
{Baby cuz It's Not a Game}
You see them mothafuckin' twenty-inch chromes spinnin'?
{Rocked out, baby, ice hangin'}

[Ghostface Killah (RZA):]
Bailed out from drugs, almost retired from bubblin'
Hammers was the guns under the rug, lift off my publishin'
Jet to Miami, I chuggle-lug the beat
Fiends beepin' me, I erase and delete (Come on)
Surrounded my palm trees and sound-proof condos
Tryin' out Spanish foods, Roberto's bangin' bongos
Do whatever, crackin' down weather, it means nice
Walkin' down the strip, these fat niggaz broke the ice
Drive it in a host, the trucks, the gate's wide open
A square box fell out, I'm hopin' it be coke and
I snatched it, dipped into a parkin' lot and wrapped it
See diamonds, pearls, rubies, gems, covered with acid
Heavens to mega-troid, infants'll know I'm paranoid
What she goes through, I'm on a next flight to St. Croix
Sneaker boy and Genius, I heard he struck oil
Him and Masta Killa own Fox and mad loyal

[Chorus: last two lines only]
Diamonds, Cubans hangin' from our neck, baby
Come on, come on

[Interlude: RZA {Prodical}]
{The finest, baby, the finest}
(You see them Linx hangin'?)

[ShaCronz:]
Yo, yo
You know I rarely fight, I keep heat plus I'm very nice
I run with two-eighties on me like Jerry Rice
I fuck with many birds, not the canary type
I've seen a lot of happy days and scary nights
My click hotter than fish grease, kids be diss-free
Most of these labels can't handle this heat
I love new twat, scrap ho's on a few blocks
When my hate grows I let the tools pop
A lot of these rap niggaz be fast to plea
Raw cook up, Got the Hook-Up like Master P
F.G., we don't talk, nigga, fast to squeeze
Walk up and let a hundred shots crash ya V
The first to pull out, the first to body somethin'
I got all the heat all the shorties in ya lobby pumpin'
Them dudes you standin' with probably frontin'
Killa Bee Gang got that shit that keep ya hottie jumpin'
What?

[Chorus x2]

[Interlude: RZA {Prodical}]
{Straight like that, baby, it's nuttin' less, K.B., baby
Don't forget it, C.C.F.}
You see the shits spinnin'?
Come on, nigga! {Clamp on, baby} Come on!
Yo, yo, tell them niggaz, son
What? What?
You see the shits spinnin'? {Yeah}
Shit hangin', son, they hangin' {Better catch it}
Come on! Come on!

[Outro: Prodical (RZA)]
Straight gangsta
(Yo, you've just been experiencin'
Wu-Tang Killa Beez - The Sting)
Explosive, baby, comin' at you
(Y'all mothafuckas know..
The next chamber's the mothafuckin' weather)
Look out for the Stingers, bab
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of wordly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
their life and times, deadly like the virus design
but too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind

You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

[Masta Killa]
A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
to skin irritations, babies being born with
disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear world relations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
bitter sickness, and left us to witness

[U-God]
Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than Wu is golden game
The wise self flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and then caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man would be within these stripes pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best

You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

[RZA]
Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
while your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe

[Method Man]
As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other

You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
[Intro:]
Black Knights
West coast Killa Bee kill
Black Knights, Black Knights
You hear it from the distance

(Yo) my brain sprouts branches blossoming tragic thoughts
Takes bully lyrics lunch money, pistols or microphone
Welcome to L.A. battle the unexplained
Scarecrows and apples meet Mr. Constrictus
Concrete knuckles and scuffles, I waste groups
Give 'em lumps the size of footballs, bricks and grapefruit
Make soup, blueberry while dining with classic monsters
Better check my sponsor chop before you can answer
Brothers in the Contra, bullet holes in the stop sign
Gods in the neighborhood, pistol in the sunset
Lyrics, the bitch pressed dump trucks with one thrust
Faster than sound, light, or speed that your gun busts
Among us, west coast wreck hopes, infect dope
Whining 'cause your last Holocaust cassette broke
The hunchback tic-tac heads come to get you
Nine-hundred and forty-three missiles made of crystal
Light a match to those, the crowd put all their lighters up
Stomp through the graveyard in the rain, the architect
Bricks in the mud, the cold weather is scorchin
For boxcar children and orphans, wrote a portrait
Chewing on cactus, rappers better practice
Slimey like a catfish, dollers in the mattress
A hand-carved pipe from Baton Rouge to Cherokee
Grand-high count, feed Macadamias to parakeets
French lemonade, skeletons on the highway
Clove, gets rowdy I'll box my way out
Poor righteous teacher, devils better fear us
Or my pistol splatter your brains accross the mirrors

Bluntz, martinez, girls, and gunz (gunz)

Gut 'em like a fish, the man who bled Marbles
Bloody Mr. Fixit, holocaust and guns
Stumbled through the doorway wearing my evening chains
Real as the hallway red and blue Crayolas
Now leaving stains, architect from Cali
Rumble through the mist covered valleys, dirty alleys
Crumbs in your suitcase, ice fishing with pelicans
Big 'ole tackling skeleton, you're irrelevant
Riding jeweled elephants, California horizon
Track mud through the kitchen, murder henchmen
Strange man's pockets, cigarettes and candy
Walk with a limp, chance of a lifetime
Bandits want cyborg crank, tic-tac
Blow holes through emcees, size of bowling balls
Briefcase man chant, my flavor's building
Set a fishbowl full of jelly beans out for the neighbor's children
Two-fisted brawler, good times in the sunlight
Tracked him one night, you call and cause a gunfight
Holo-holocaust is sleepy, holdin microphones
4 dead men in the alley, the butcher
Shirts with the blossoms, west coast the gentlemen
Holding the pistol, smoke blunts for hours
To understand the language of flowers
Gritty mugshot, missed her arms and legs, drool bullets
Bedtime time to turn in but into what?
A well set table, third rock from the sun
Dead men hung, Cadillacs and dinosaurs
Hot peanuts and fireworks, the holocaust

Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz girlz and gunz girlz and gunz

Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz girlz and gunz girlz and gunz
[Chorus: Rza]

You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock

Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock
Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]

Here's something to advertise, promote it keep the fan satisfied
Load data for the disc drive, ghetto citywide
Leave em paralyzed,they stolen every word i provide
Without no clearence, i nurture this track like Amish parents
Got requests from retail stores, for my appearence
First we target it, then they market it, to kill ya artist wit
The hungry shark, contra hit, whoevers starting shit
Got as many rap soldiers, for how much this record ships
Fuck them niggaz you record with,I make them forfit
Send a bomb rap fed ex into ya office, son we buil and deliver
Came to build with the Gza,
check the chorus from the Rza, the real album spitta
Me and my street team be holding congress meetings
Audio visual video treatments internationally speaking
Got managers scared to shop you, ready to drop you
Its the comming of the newest hip hop christ
Pop you, try the BDS and soundskins from war fans
Ya whole roster cant take on, one Sun of Man
Get ya street team,get ya sickest out, put ya posters up
Boost ya bucket up, still Razah gonna fuck it up!

[Chorus: Rza]

You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
fuck wit the Wu we bustin ya whole snot box
Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock
Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop

[Verse 2: Gza]

Industrialize niggaz change soon as ya get in
Throw em on a auction block, CEOs bidding
Highest price paid, for them wack rhymes made
It's over rated, cut off, never reinstated
I be fruitful, and multiply with marvelous tales
Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell
I laid the first verse and quenched a dry ass niggaz thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst
Full tank, with the premium quallity raps
Mickey mouse niggaz get caught on the trap
Ya cottonelle kids from scottsdale cleanex
Looking like rockwell wearing Vnecks
Ya learn from this earn from this
Niggaz getting tossed and turned for this, burned for this
Extort from a thousands degrees of live MCs
I melt ya niggaz down to the size of fleas

[Verse 3: Timbo King]

The microphonus, collect the bonus, aiyo we on this
House niggaz verse the homeless
Ten to one, Tim's the one
Royal famous,the verbal painless
The dark gallery, million dollar pictures
Import from poor to riches, leanin on doors
We move across the broklynn bridge doing 60
Illegal driving, from dusk to red dawn
The Gza/Genius, Wu-tang we live long

[Verse 4: Dreddy Kruger]

True indeed, I hook tracks like my seed
Persona, wack MCs do me notta
King solomon the great,came to evaporate the fake
Yeah you, you know your power-U
Ya reconize the voice, it's that nigga from the Wu
Every dart i spit gets mastered and promoted
ya just been demoted, cause ya sweet and sugar coated
Ya folded, ya style is half stale and molded
So mold it

[Chrous: Rza]

You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
fuck wit the Wu we bustin ya whole snot box
Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock
Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop
[Intro/Chorus: Raekwon]
Murder one of y'all niggaz..
Get to hurtin one of y'all niggaz..
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggaz

[Raekwon the Chef]
... kick dirt
Color glocks splitters just listen there's UFO visitors
Fly paintings remainin, reclinin pro-comissioner
One boot off he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off
Hibernatin, dead in the makin, ear-rake him, gear-rake him
Technician murderer, Wu hit the universe
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes bust
Tip bottles, Movado, sailin in some Wu googles you follow
Mail and jail letters, sendin niggaz lottos
What made you murder my flow, what made you rival my clothes
What made you -- fuck it, yo son these niggaz gotta owe
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes
We paintin pictures if it's (?) I seen a lot of those
Gettin fly with Ghost, power just buy the boats
RZA your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose
Off the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho

[Masta Killa]
Devestatin shockwaves strikin the nation
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form
In any form mixed untampered it's pure
Dissect each line of the rhyme
Find my ingredients and nutrients
Teach patience and obediance before movement
Killer bee student enrollment
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk
Slang therapist Shallah Rae
plus the people, with magnificent wordplay

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Aiyyo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin fast
Expose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft
I don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin past in an alley with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs wanna play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass
Compose a smash, rollin grass at Ghost lab

[samples scratched: "drink to your new life.. iron flag brothers"]
[beez buzzing]

[Warcloud:]
West Coast, West Coast
Killa Beez
Antlers, hammers and hacksaw, the wizard
Poetry of a man with no name, America
Cement mixed walled and born in ice cream
Holocaust the Minnie, greet with bloody handshake
Wu Empire and colleagues, luxurious
You torn like tape off football helmets, chip
Four cups of crushed bricks, half cup of roses
Smoke a green and yellow candycane
Zombies still move through the college with orange teeth
Pistols still pointed at the floor, spinal crumbs
Blood hits snow and hard, scooped up in hand fulls
Bathe in the river, the waterfall runs red
Sasquatch, Yeti, battallion with one head
In a lonely place, dollars, razors and marbles
We break open forearms, Earth the last hour
Out in the tea house playing a hand of spades
Fist full of grenades, blow out the watch light
Convicts rally at moon set, the last
Flow stay smoggy, old carnival wind chime
Sideshow freaks, belly dancers and gypsies
One of the wood cutters, village Architect
Eighty-eight sandwiches, Thurmos in a lunch box
In a harsh realm, during the end of butterflies
Flutter diamond moths, both with dusty wings
Bodies lay soaked in a desert, throats gouged out
Tongues spit out of their heads, I had a purpose
Will you still love me tomorrow? Architect
Will you still love me tomorrow? Holocaust

[Timbo King:]
Royal Famous, blame us
Yo
My first whip be a Chrysler
So when you see me you say, "Chrys' is comin"
Ice numbin ya neck, throw one of those
Strong notes, Indian pose, flat footed
Yo my back hearts, feel like them crumbled wings
Bless by the Heaven kings, my crown piece seven rings
Money to earn, money to burn
Give some, lend some, take it, fuck it
Be stingy off a stash if you have to
Nigga, what? Flip a pack of if you have to
Passion, pawn the shit, ya highest bidder
Buy from the streets, cop at wholesale price
Motel models, go tell five-oh
Five-oh follow the black El Dorado

[Crisis:]
Who got that real shit niggaz blast to, bitches shake they ass to?
Hit you up with the hood when we pass through
Black Knights, Royal Fam got that hot shit (yo)
Topless in the cockpit of my drop six
.. in the cockpit of the drop six

[Meko the Pharaoh:]
Yeah, yo
Give me beats like this I start burnin
Wack MC's, ya still learnin
Just like punk cops that rotate on ya block
Millions of people was gonna hear the North Stars shot
While the worlds rock mental, I hold presidential
Bare essentials, Wu-Tang credentials
Makin niggaz catch wind chills when my N.S. wind build
Niggaz better get real
Even though I stay pissy drunk, run with Kurupt
In a red mini van fed tinted, smokin on that spinach
All funny niggaz get planted
I got that Long Beach shit like J. Bennett
The rest of y'all niggaz sound like women
Scared of my sword when it's given
Y'all niggaz better stop pretendin
Cuz the words like I'll speak, we'll keep 'em printed
Kill or be killed is what I'm representin
.. representin

[Cilvaringz:]
Yo, yo, check it, yo
As 7 clouds form the storm,
I baffle Gabriel the archangel with death, death to
his first born, Earth mourns Wu Killa Beez on the swarm
From the battleship throw darts that be acrid
We ninjas, we backflip with tactics of antrax
Arise like the novice from earth under canvas
Of the Clan, fist to fist, kamikaze shock this
Like Nazi documents Apache Helicopters strike down
near the bunker of the Glocksmiths
Shop the Dirty Weaponry, Tecs from the 70's
Gone With the Wind, I slung mines within
My men tackle dikes with the 7 deadly dicks
Neglect my covenant, my government enslaves you to my
Hall o Double Justice and bloodstains your judgement
so prepare to be slain by the truth
It's Blood for Blood When All Hell Breaks Loose son

Wu-Tang Killa Beez from Shaolin Europe
Black Knights, Royal Fam
It's Cilvaringz, on
[Intro: RZA]

Up from the 36 Chambers...
Heheh.. it's the Ghost..(Face)..(Killahh) Hehheheh

Ghost Face Killer, the Method Man, Raekwon the Chef, the Master Killer
Raw Desire, LeVon, Power Cipher
Twelve O'Clock, Sixty Second Assassin, the 4th Disciple
The Brand White
K.D. the Down Low Wrecka, Shyheim AKA The Rugged Child
Doo-Doo Wales, Mista Hezakiah -- better known as the Yin and the Yang
The Tru Masta, Asan, DJ Skane, The Tru Robocop comin thru
Scientific Shabazz, my motherfuckin man Wise the Civilized
The Shaolin Soldiers, Daddy-O and Popa Ron
Comin down from the motherfuckin South end of things

Killa beez all over your fuckin planet
Thirty-six chambers of death
Three-hundred and sixty degrees of perfected styles
Choppin off your motherfuckin dome...
...peace, and every fuckin borough
Crooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island
The motherfuckin Bronx, killa beez....

(The sword? C'mon, give him the sword)

[Chorus: The Genius]

Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggaz on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to...

[Verse One:]

The Wu is comin thru, the outcome is critical
Fuckin wit my style, is sort of like a Miracle
on 34th Street, in the Square of Herald
I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald --
-- ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow
Cuz the hoe didn't win but the sun will still come out tomorrow
and shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballentine
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones, the GZA
One who just represent the Wu-Tang click
With the game and soul, of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
so stop, the life you save may be your motherfuckin own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's comin thru with Full Metal Jackets
God squad that's mad hard to serve
Come frontin hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves

[Chorus]

[Verse Two:]

The response while I bomb that ass, "You ain't shit!"
Your wack ass town had you gassed
Egos is somethin the Wu-Tang crush
Souped up niggaz on a stage get rushed
I don't give a god damn, on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got, or who knows you kid?
Cuz I don't know ya therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants ahhh human feces!
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time come strapped with a fuckin Pamper
How ya sound B? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ the catcher, he's my man
Anyway he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't FUCK with those in the major leagues

[Chorus - 2X]

Hoods on the right
Punks in the back... to what
Niggaz on the left
Hoods on the right
Punks in the back, c'mon... to what
...let your feet stomp
...brag shit to death
...wild for the night
(Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu)
(Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu)
(Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu)
Niggaz on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
[Kung Fu sample]
I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
but still for many men just to hear of the name
fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
[beat drops]
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"

[RZA (Method Man)]
Yo..
[sounds of fighting]
(Uh-huh)

[Kung Fu Sample]
We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!

[Method Man (Raekwon)]
Yeah, (Eh yo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must part seis all the time, kids)
(Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo) We're back!

[Raekwon]
Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
and then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, Few Good Men that'll rep
Invade your strongarm', Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props in sales, all yellow L's, cops sleepin on nails
Niggaz get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin them pounds, yo
Last on niggaz, great adventures of my niggaz
and cast out pictures, sendin a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggaz rewrite the trend
Wu niggaz did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man heat handle beef

[Chorus: Method Man]
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in

[GZA]
Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MC's
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level, then we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed, it's like the shot "On the Dock of the Bay"
that slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on a fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance encouragement

[Chorus x2]

[Method Man]
It be The Lost Tribe, 7 Days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The Uncontrolled Substance got me spittin up nuff bars, disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin thru Hell, yellin and cussin
at MC's in my circumfrance, y'all niggaz hand-cuffin
these hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin, yea, and I'ma a keep hustlin
with Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me, everytime you kiss that hoe you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk a mile in my Sauconys

[Chorus x2]

[Masta Killa (Method Man)]
(AHHHHH!!!!)
We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the bangles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wizes scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious, bless mic pure defness
Awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake! [echoes]

[Chorus x2]

[Kung Fu sample]
You've been busy
Are you mastered?
[x3]
You've been busy here..
[Intro: P.C. (ShaCronz)]
Yeah, heh.. mothafucka!
Yeah, big C, big dog
(Don't hate on us, we gon' get you
Big waiters, spectators)

[Chorus: Bapteest]
Hatin' Don't Pay, no way, no way
Hatin' Don't Pay.. no way, no way
Hatin' Don't Pay, no way, no way
Hatin' Don't Pay.. no way, no way

[ShaCronz:]
Beyond a, Reasonable Doubt
I'm gangsta, won't hesitate to put the heat to ya mouth
Peep me out, tie up ya chick for them ki's in ya couch
We get money, go outta town, hustle for weeks than be out
Rapid flows are dramatic, I'm here to let y'all bastards know
My heart's colder than Alaskan snow, I could rip beats fast or slow
When I let the ratchets go, come out ya face get what you askin fo'
I make haters run like relays through the P.J.'s, homey
It's B.K, C.K., D-Day, homey
Keep metal, never settle for a le-way, homey
Still keep it ghetto 'til we pay, homey
Calm ya tone when we speakin' 'less you deep and got 'matics
From the home of the Nike Air's and Reebok Classics
Pack more guns, my Desert E's drop faggots
And fuckin' with the wrong bodies, ya seats popped, bastard

[Chorus]

[P.C.:]
Yo, yo
You 'spond, submission, watch, mission to stop me
Won't be defeated cuz they broke and they bitches is sloppy
They got me hot so I'm makin' niggaz laugh, haha, seventeen dot
Every single time my gat is cocked
Y'all picked the wrong time to fuck with P dot C period
Just when you thought I was playin', I'm anout to get serious
Plus I'm furious and heated now, drunk and weeded now
Mothafuckas don't learn, suburbans leave 'em beaten now
O's to you ho's, leave 'em visions disposed
Like a tag can be placed on they toes - sippin' Hater-ade
Get some gators made, hustle, bought a trade
Cop a couple of locks before you get to speakin' on ya flock
Why you mad at me? Cuz I got a featurin' spot?
I guess you'd rather see me shot or somewhere strung out on rocks
Cuz I keep my mind on my grind 'til I reach the top
Go on and plot, ya haters'll never make me stop
Hatin' Don't Pay..

[Chorus]

[Freemurder:]
Yeah, yeah, yo
Niggaz try to hate me like, I roll all crazy and
Let the three-eighty blow, Free got crazy dough
Frontin' for ya ho's, run through that lady coke
Music got you amped, now you leanin' on that radio
Niggaz and bitches, soon to become ho's
Black suit in a casket soon'll become yo's
My Mac shoot these bastards who want war
That's what my gun for, nigga fuck the gun law
I'm the reason they act like that
They'll make Free react like that
Find the gat on ya hat like that
Media'll wonder why I rap like that
Even behind the booth I'm strapped on a track like that
Brooklyn, nigga, throw shells 'round ya head
Wake up, shells surround ya bed
Hit ya with the pound instead
Y'all don't want me to do this
Hatin' Don't Pay, now Jake found you dead
Uh!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Freemurder]
Yo it's Freemurder, ShaCronz, P dot C period
Don't hate us, don't hate the game
Cuz the game don't hate you
The game don't even know you
You got to know the game
And remember, only the players change
The game stays the same.
[Raekwon the Chef]
The Fuck?
It's just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow...
That's how we doin it

Bound by honest sword take over the set; rap from here to Que-bec
Throw up the tech, crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggaz fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Askin my man'll get you slapped down; play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who rip it?

[God] Projects

Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime

Blast at any Close Encounter of the Third Kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle, any adversary

Hear me, you jam all you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coke aimin at cha kidney
Pressure, Red Hot like Chili Pepper
Black 'n Decker, hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector

Suck my dick it's the kid with the fat knob

Quick get on your knees, with yo' sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spread it in shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently, on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world of wombs titty saggin
Stomach on some scriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screamin that it's
TALKIN TO YOU DADDY, fart's breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar, to try to tighten up your ginger
All-mighty dick, ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attatched to God
Thick, like a great adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbin my shit
You bit it on the couch, dry pussy leave the friction burns
Plus beef I hone, the condom broke
Bitch you got AIDS I'm shakin in my bones
[Intro: sample]
Looking on various street corners
I'm sure you've seen it yourself
Standing on the corner, is an alleged brother
Dressed in blue or green, red and black
And, spouting the news, that the revolution is coming
And you better get ready, sort of like
The end of the world is coming, unfortunately
The world is just gonna get dragged on and on
And, we have a poem that we've written particularly
For the brothers on the street corners

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, standing on porches in front of houses and corner stores
I'm born to more, horrific than syphilis, cuz where we live is
Hell on earth, where was heaven when shit's real
We sold dope to get mill, for white folks in Smith field
Fuck Israel, it's Kill Hills, spilt pills for my bill
Write wills for my seeds, to live from, who take some
Who give some, for brothers that was lynched hung, the symptoms
Never go away, a stir away from colder ways
Having ramblings and savages, blessed, from us asking
This whole cross, is more rust in Florida oranges and lost orphans
I offer thought for food in full courses
I've soared into the night glow, my hat's low, my roots grow
For you to soon know, I reap what you sow

[Solomon Childs]
We just land down from Liberia, young black man
In control of the pillars, millions buried in dirt
How many railroads do you own? How much clean chrome you own
This for my ancestors names engraved in stone
On the roads where the rebels once roamed
We built homes, civilized our own
King Solomon Childs, beautiful as black, this time
We will walk on water, this time
We will see through the lies, this time
Prepare troops to move in, expand the runways
Build bigger bridges, nine millimeters from brady
We living in war, so prepare for submission
Apache helicopters, a black man's face on a dollar
The pigs constantly watch us, the streets is obnoxious
Baby of the first nine, homey, in toxic

[Byata]
The first seed of a dope fiend, she A.D.D
Needle parked off spring boughed, by she, wanna be
While her siblings is rich living, she ain't bitching
Mama's working two jobs, try'nna maintain a living
Few years passed, now she's getting raised by the streets
Side by side, watchin' hustles, now she blazed like the streets
This is for my women living in the struggle
Getting brought into this world without asking for the troubles
Of the every day life-life, a battered wife
A single mother's holding it down, while the world so trife
Crack fiend, you could of been something better in life
Now hold your head up, ma, you know it ain't over, right?
Yeah, this is for my Russians on the grind
Off the boat struggling try'nna hold a nine to five
Yeah, I seen enough with these eyes
I thank the most high, I'm still alive
[Verse One: Ghostface Killah]

Aiyyo I roll like a bat out of hell
Evil acapell's fly spittin out of my grill
Before I hit the sky with springtime colors
Juicy as a Sunkist, certain broads double dutch this
They carve it in they wrist, pales berry blazes
Straighten the crumbs left on the stove, clothes in my lady hair
Plus yours the look gold God, the old tainted bald technique
Got these vestibules designer niggaz in they whips
jumpin out they seats, eighteen, Bronzeman Part II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice
We in your hood we might circle, hats down low in the Range
Switch lanes, change my tire, peel out
Real loud on the stage yo, I shitted on your hood kid
I shitted on your hood, got to your burner too late
I'm lookin real good, draped out
Shinin like a fresh fifty cent piece, your girlfriend, c'mere
Oh shit, you my man's niece, the gourmet pocket twenty
bombs made of clay, Sexcapades take place
We fucked in forty-eight shades might walk up in your studio
time slap your engineer, it's lighter fluid to that style
Hand me the matches now

[Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef]

Aiyyo rainbow Roley on the wrist, now what's this
Niggaz bless this, eight and a half, Bally banana twist
E shakes, puffin on lye, feedin the seed's plate
Pullin out, old dirty eights to rob gates
Major wake up, the kid telltales, make a nigga head wake up
Beats break, the nigga would take off his time
Honolulu status, gladdest
the rich rock cabbage and dollar vans grands
That nigga mad savage, stationary Hall of Justice
Niggaz came clumped out
Just came home, now they bunked out
Money be longer than triple life
til the sun burn out, that's my word
Move it with the burner out
Fidel way of thinkin, roll with the Mac bent Ac-10
Most of my team, Five Percent check what the live said
Rollin with Guess vests pedestrians yo
holdin my nuts, fuckin thousand dollar lesbians

[Ghost] Yo, the Older God put me on and had to rock this
[both] Maintain Three-Sixty Lord live prosperous
[Ghost] It only takes a lesson a day, just to analyze life
[both] one time in the respectable mind
[repeat 2X]

[Verse Three: The Genius/GZA]

Let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness, forget his, original statement
Even in protection programs there's no escapement
Gunned down, we in town, hit king from seven crowns
Spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded, back in the eighty-three summer heat
Up in three-oh-nine park, rhymin off the drummer's beat
I stalk the city streets demonstratin mic wrecks
All lookin stank, I ain't playin wit a full deck
And as they nervously stare, I know they scared
They saw the coming of Wu, the neon in Times Square
Household name, assassin, killa bee
Mill to the grain, that posess the Wu, trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
Those that got styles, they got identical twins
Don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finnicky
without skills, they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age

[rocket fired, whistles off and explodes, breaking glass]
[bees buzzing]

[Prodigal Sunn:]
Ladies and gentlemen: Sunz of Man
Uhh, Jungle of Concrete
yo, yo

[Chorus: x4]
In the jungle, we gotta rumble with the bees/wee
Ain't nothin sweet, we gotta eat

[Timbo King:]
Yo, we come from starvin days, runnin up in Dr. J's
Rock away, so the mega trades, diggin, pockin days
Yo, the aids wasn't in, calm braids all trimmed
Army suits snatched and Timbs
You'se a friend, snatch a gem

[Prodigal Sunn:]
I spent a lifetime of doin crime, hustlin dimes, guzzlin wine
Smugglin wives, one of a kind
Under the sunshine, movin as one mind, the genuine
Star child, Allah's style, many say their barber's wild
When I element the foul, prowl, upon the weekend of sweet
I gotta eat, generate with the heat, demolish beats
Collectin sheets, war with beast, Islamic warrior
Livin the mass hysteria, the bomb shell of America
Swell competors, explicit lyrics from the editor
Realistic predator, the rhyme writer, climb heights
Rhymes ignite, MC's reputation, blown out of sight
On the mic device, my crew get nice, shoot dice
Doin callistetics, young diplomatics with automatics
The asiatic, fuck a fanatic, I split his attic
You don't want no static, I make you carriage for the rabbits

[Chorus x2]

[Hell Razah:]
We've got to take what we want, let these others rappers front
Yo, take that, you ain't goin get it laid back
Best record what I say, ain't no time to playback
That's right platinum hits, yo, before the age at
Gather millions, acapella in the streets, today crack
Fuck opinions, I'm hittin to the nights endin
A new beginin, takin over men and women
Thoughts used for sinnin, neighborhood no grinin
Thug religions, expeditions, startin for a mil
Stick the student for his intuition
Beyond college, street knowledge, got to eat knowledge
Off the tree of life, while seek wallets
Credit cards, some trust for their gods
In the Wizard of Oz, you get it all to get robbed
Price is on the food and the Earth's precious jewels
Ain't the golden rules from the golden black jewels
Steppin out the furnace, only run with fast learners
Burn cash and we stash burners
We be the underground childs, mainstream now
Sort of like Apocalypse, bloaw, blaow
Take what you own, must return to your home
Claim back your throne, we're on a higher zone
Black Lazurus, plus we're not havin it
Pass the diamonds on the wrist, we're on some take the earth shit
Demolish every tool, that y'all niggaz work with
The barcode, bio chips be short circuited

[62nd Assassin:]
Here in this jungle, jungle, jungle ?
I'm livin through, your crew on the subject
The loot, I'm new improved
Plus my time piece is bullet proof
I need a bulldozer or crane, that stains like in vain
You be the blood and I be the drainin on
Forgot to burn your proper on, with the tool stone
Written, founded dead on this spot
You emergin, believe I'm the surgeon
Rhymes leave your brain on all right, double scenes
Back hand, slap you, clap thoughts, like evil raps
Play that, what it slap right back
You was seen, soak the zeen
Self esteem, so common, even suckers die
Major League, total assassinator, rhyme complicator
The devil and the sword bring death, feed Jamaica
Rain or hurricane, step on my house
Into the house on severe pain, strong like a pyramid
Nothin but various parts of the house that Jack built
The little house on the praire, I huff and I puff
And I blow your brain to a seisure
Before you step to me, you should of called off
Ceaser's father, mercy words, I'm no joke
I cancer smoke, I reply, "your brain and told"
I live for my tech 9, uzi, grenade, all cause of one rhyme
Better believe, sleeves, I buck you chicken
Make you love us, my mic around your neck to bug it

[Chorus x4]

[various talk to fade]
[Sampled singer]
The storm is..

[Chorus x2: Solomon Childs]
Females better try to trick me now
Cats better try and Out Think Me Now
Stick me now, maybe even kill me now
Let me dominate for two years strong
You motherfuckers'll never stop the storm

[Solomon Childs]
What? Yeah..
Uh-huh, what? Yeah..
You cowards follow, I'ma lead
Millenium speed, Jeopardy, Greed
Golden seed, militant breed
This is all a real thug need
Science of life dunn, black Oriental
Forever bronze to star, day room war
Apocalypse raw
Limit the sky, let me simplic-ify
Mama said, "God should never cry"
War with The Source, ya girl know me, straight live
Found out swine was in Pop Tarts in '85
You old school cats is talkin jive
320 E, bumping Tony Starks shit
I don't trust a soul
I don't trust Canal Street gold
I don't trust Timberland's double sole
I don't trust cats on the block who done told
I don't trust Avirex leathers when it be cold
Settin fire to ya rap books
Frontin you could get punched in ya mouth
King of New York, this is what a thug about

[Chorus x2]

[Solomon Childs]
Uh.. yeah..
Apocalypse gifted storm, eyes of Islam
Pain inside Maria eyes
Money low got the Gods in the streets heated
Left the Queens in the world seated
Two kids my baby mom's speeded
Poverty, swears Allah cheated
Keep it strawberry, catchin cancer
Missin the World Series
Solomon Childs extraordinaire
Power of the dollar
Body Brighton, Allah body
Thugged out, ready to flip
2000 New York rookie
Hard to hit, who want beef?
Put 'em on the murder cross, imperial laws
Consider me bein top rank
with Pony and Frank
Yo what the deal, Lunar?
No more small cookies
Rather get paid and crush rookies
Me and Mama gettin land with this voice box
Tracks hotter than the Red Sox
Who ever had doubts..
Yo Baby Boy, this is what a thug about

[Chorus x2]

[sampled singer]
The storm is
"The story you're about to see, occured along the main
trading route, on the border between the North and South..
at a small outpost called Red Clay Village."

[RZA]
What the fuck y'all niggaz thought, huh?  What you thinkin bitch?
Are you stupid son, must be stupid kid
What the fuck is wrong?  It's the Wu bitch
Ain't got a clue bitch, tie ya shoe bitch
Get the fuck back, 'fore we break a f... listen
Tryin to tell y'all niggaz, give you a fair warnin
Just a chance to live, so you can see ya kids
Yo son nah, before I split ya wig
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it
So now you got to FEEL IT!!

[beat changes]

[Masta Killa]
Yo what the, yo
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck
Y'know how we do it in the hood
Yo.. yeah.. turn the mic up, yeah, yo

Y'all niggaz better rock y'all hoodies
Take money snatch jewelry, in the hood
You find the best woman lookin good
Diamond she need polishin
In my hood, all the gunshot legal
At the same time we gotta stop killin our people
Keep it in the hood, niggaz walk with they gun
Keep it in the hood that's where we come from
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta
I know a few murderer, drug dealer
In the hood, we speak mathematics and build
What's the total weight of the brain, Allah real
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the hood; 80 proof
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects
Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark
Movin with the Wesson
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson
Pussyhole testin, in the hood
Got the word from the hoodrat, shorty on the wood

[Chorus: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder

[Inspectah Deck]
Ay yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods
It ain't all good, pass the goods
Deep in the project halls waitin to shine
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs
In the hood, niggaz put twenty on Hoopties
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip, a hoe on the strip
And roll dick throw on the flip
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?
Far from ya Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood
From project chicks with hips and slim waists
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths
O.G, I spit G to the young ones
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from

[Chorus: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder

[Streetlife]
This is the place where thugs is born - in the hood
Blink to long ya life is gone - in the hood
Convicts still live with they mom
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm - in the hood
Crack fiend'd furnish a 'Llac - in the hood
African's be drivin cabs - in the hood
In the streets the ghetto is hot
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops - in the hood
The ones you love'll fill you with slugs - in the hood
Babies born addicted to drugs - in the hood
We make life or death decisions
And the school system is like a minimal prison
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
In the hood, it ain't all good, repent or you sinnin

[Chorus x2: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder
[Ghostface Killah:]
The technique is ill son, watch how I spill one
Peace to Biggie, 2Pac, Big L and Big Pun
Havoc on the streets of Staten, snitches
House niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern
Somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
Hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
For those that murdered me shall stand before God
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

What the fuck is going on, I can't go to sleep
Feds jumping out their jeeps, I can't go to sleep
Babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep
Ish bowled two 6's twice, I couldn't go to sleep
Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns
Whippy got hit up with the big shit, bong bong
Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
Drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot
Not knowing, fucking with me you get your meat chopped
You thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped
Call on the chariots, call on an ambulance
You better smile, my nigga you on Candid Cam
Gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls
Nigga, motherfucking eunuch, I even take which was yours
I'm the nigga that made you, man
When your rap wasn't doing well I'm the nigga that gave you a hand

[Isaac Hayes:]
Don't kill your brother, learn to love each other
Don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad
Look at who you are, you've come too far
It's in your hands, just be a man
Get the jelly out your spine
Cobwebs out of your mind

[RZA:]
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes
They shot the father at his mom's building seven times
They shot Malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
Jesse watched as they shot King on the balcony
Exported Marcus Garvey cause he tried to spark us
With the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
Her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
America's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
What's the science? Somebody? This is trick knowledge
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
Walking through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck
Looking around like these Devils
I'm ready to break this world down
They got me trapped up in a metal gate
Just stressed out with hate
And just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
What should I do, grab a blunt or a brew
Grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut em, son, I..

[Isaac Hayes:]
Don't let the game make you lose your head
You should be calling the shots instead
The power is in your hands
Stop all this crying and be a man
[U-God]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Vendetta inside, swiftly start stabbin
One second to meltdown, feel the twin cannons
Burn, handgun herns, standin firm
Return from mega-death, I'll tell you what's left
Dilemma, Earth tremor, up by man
With the Grand Canyon rap, U dynamic wingspan
The Power from the Clan, yo, is more than fantastic
Pull pins out the hazard, on this Battlestar Galactic'
Skull tactic, sporatic, Asiatic, long awaited
Son of Sam, mention the mic mutated
You hated us, cuz we immortal on wax
Rip the China White shit, flip a dynamite ax
Shillac em perhaps, the heart pump an anti-toxin
Feed me the Power, meteor shower when I'm boxin

[Chorus: U-God]
Professional vets, now comin through vexed
I'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?
The S on your chest, better stand for Super-stress
And Leatha Face pressed, next, here to set you
REC! I suggest niggas come To the Rescue

[Leatha Face]
I know how to part your medula, oblong gotta
Test the rocket launcher, they'll get conquered
By my block sponsers, monster Tonka truck ya
The whole train conductor
A hole in your spine, rip your stomach mothafucka
Brotha suffer, my Dutch puff as sinister as the Feds
Infrared, signin on the glock, splittin ya head
Drippin wet from death threat messages I inject
Intellect reflects worldwide over Internets
Heart colder than Winter Fresh, chest smokin like incense
Vets broken into the flesh, soakin in ya own mess
Chrome bleds, some of the known best soldier vets
Over cassette, you get smashed like crashed desert air shows
Holdin ya breath, gaggin for a bit of oxygen
Submission put a stop to men, reveal the foul document
Lockin position, invision, adapt critical condition
Pitiful you didn't listen, now we're spiritual blessin
Viewer discretion advised, sabotage satellites
Splatter guys, get ya food ate like I'm Big Mac and fries
Trap nines in the thighs, symbolize real lives
Instill a rocket fuck from the inside to the outside
In ya mouth lied the barrel, subdue bone marrow
Ya tone shadow, blown from high-explosive poem battles
Dome smack, you live, projectiles effectin you
Incredible new wave heart, blade sharp verses sexin you
Claim professional, but I never met you
Son I never forget you
I slaughter foes when my particles wet you
To the Rescue

[Chorus: U-God]
Professional vets, now comin through vexed
I'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?
The S on your chest, better stand for Super-Stress
The Golden Arms pressed, next, here to set you
REC! I suggest niggas come To the Rescue

[U-God]
Slash hope, raw burnin, freezin thoughts are cold
Ballistic missle lift off, now one behold
My throat harden for Harlem, harness the volume
With grief fallin on me in a breeze, the seas partin
It's two men awesome, uncanny
The handy man crook, the rap gank where every damn nook and cranny
Plus four more opponents couldn't throw me, couldn't slam me
I told you before, this is war, it's radical claw
Menate the the law, practice my ambition
Understand determination, plus my burnin condition
Rebuild 'em, sing a song strong for disaster
Scorch 'em on a letter, clever, bled 'em much faster
Exotic lens, bionic Timb's, hardco' organic
The floor panic when revolvin, Shaolin dodgin
Potion of my juice, it's "Houston we have a problem"
Its Basic Instinct, motor mouth, hold is sacred
The Rushmore Rock Face, one four shot with the greatness
Raw shoulders, sword colder, no remorse
The crash course, the portions of my Porsche
Divorse it, the Holocaust exhaust, driven with force
Mighty ship back on course, I almost lost it
Toss the smokin corpse, seldom sing
Shells amongst men, rebellion, teens formin and swarmin
Vikin style, strikin without warnin a nation
Standin ovation, rap devastation
New animation, the scandal
Bandle the best part, damsel in distress, I'll bless you
God damn you! To the rescue

[Chorus: U-God]
Professional vets, now comin through vexed
I'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?
The S on your chest, better stand for Super-Stress
The Golden Arms pressed, next, here to set you
REC! I suggest niggas come To the Rescue
[Chorus x2: all]
Life is a struggle, with so many hustles
That we can juggle, we all wanna bubble
So just to get richer, we sit and sip liquor
And plot to get figures, only with my niggas

[Crisis:]
Late night, LAPD lurkin like a great white
In bloody waters, yo we doggin cuz my click stay tight
Pull up at the liquor sto', cuz we gotta get some Mo'
40's and blunts, smoke til I'm high, drink til I'm drunk
Bout to school Monk, cuz he like my right hand
Grab a can for Sandman
He runnin by a parked van, smoked up on the dark plan
Devious plot, know how to get a knot
Nothin major, just runnin up in the local spots
I grab the blunts and the box of Newport's for Doc
It's vice night, every block infested with cops
I jumped back in, what's crackin?
You said he had heavy traffic for 3 months
You know he got dough stackin, stop playin

[Sandman:]
Nigga I'm not playin
They got heavy traffic, closed shop at 11:30
Heard where the money be from a little birdie
Don't hesitate to speak, I've got 17 slugs
Let's make it in and out, and get the money and drugs
If you scared then go to church, where the Simpleton at?
He leave his bitch up in the house with a virtilo strap
And she timid with it, wouldn't tell that she knew who did it
We on the quest to survive, my niggas be the fittest
Let make it happen, rap, scrap or keep it cappin
Licks nice sound, cheques will keeps the goods lappin
Safe spot, lace Doc, and Monk he know what's happenin
It's just a little nappy nigga always been
trigger-happy

[Interlude: Crisis (Monk)]
(It's on, what's poppin?)
Hey, that nigga Sandman told you how it's goin down?
(4 Sho) He did? (Yeah)
Fuck it, let's go nigga

[Chorus]

[Doc Doom (Sandman):]
So S-man, what up? We gon' do this or what?
I know he sittin on somethin, we been watchin for months
(Plus his man just rolled up, he's about to Re-Up)
Let's hit em both at the same time
(Damn it's like you read my mind)
11:29, time to move out, ring the doorbells
Soon as he open the door, we whip the two's out
Everybody hit the floor, scooped up the drugs
Pistol-whipped his hoe, he said the money's up under the rug
in the master bed room (Check it out Monk)
But if you lyin, tonight all of y'all gonna be sleepin in a tomb
Monk what the hell we got?

[Monk:]
Bingo, we hit the jackpot
60 G's, 80 pounds, 2 brick, crack rocks
2 glocks, fresh out the box
It's time to smash out
Kill a bitch, empty the clips, and then shake the spot
The homies in the car, let's go, it's time to get home
Back to the spot, divide it up, so we can stack on
Sew the block up, bubble up, cuz times it's tart
Slippin in the streets, your ass'll pay to serve charge
Cuz it cost to be the boss
Tough talk and get your braces charmed
Spot Rusherz rush the spot, what the fuck you thought?

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: all]
We all wanna bubble, only with my niggas
We all wanna bubble, only with my niggas
[Dogs barking]

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
All y'all bitches put your naps together
And all you niggaz put your dicks together, bitch

[Ol Dirty starts singing]
Hoeeeee! Yah ha heh

De, haaaaa! Errr hah hahhhr
Haaaaaaaah He hawww, heahh

She flew in like calm breeze
Tall brown skin her weave like palm trees
I went coconuts
Dipped my Dunkin' between your Donut
Don't want it if it ain't no slut, bitch!
Fathership touch ground, like fly on soup
Don't invite me I tear the fuck down
White ones cut my toupee!
Seventh day rester, or scream play
I slump MC slay, it ain't nuttin to bust ass
Bullet him, get him fast
Bitch I don't break out, blast to the next rash
The dog piss on MC's like trees
Got meals but still grill that old good welfare cheese

[Ol Dirty sings again]
Hoeeeeee!
Yeah, hayyyy! Dedicated to all you bitch ass niggaz

It's alright, you still gon' get fucked tonight

You're the type of bitch don't appreciate sheeeit

That pussy there, couldn't satisfy a hair

(SLURP, SLURP) I'm Doo Doo Brown! Hehahahaha
Tossed salad, oh you in some shit now
Callin me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin can stop me from buryin my bones
in the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol Dirt Dog, but I'm not dog out
Here comes Rover, sniffin at your ass
But pardon me bitch, as I shit on your grass
That means hoe, you been shit-ted on!

[Masta Killa]
As we return, to the 36 Chambers
The RZA, the GZA
The Ol Dirty BZA
U-God, Chef, the Ghostface Killah
And Meth, Rebel I soldier for the foreclosure
Don't forget about the Masta, yo

Motherfuckers halt, when my Colt, start stompin
Thunder, strikes your land with a jolt
Your stamina level is low, like currents from
the volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye can't die-tect
the infantry, peep the weapon-try as I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
by this total square mileage of violence that I brung
I've not yet begun to stung
It's the ethics, the rigorous training methods
of the Abbott, incite overseas to opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates
Breakin down your resistance
Leavin competition defenseless, Masta
Hip-hop antagonizer, dumb deaf and blind civilizer
with the silencer

[U-God]
Psssh, yo
Pile-driver Tut boulder face blow Hulk
Anger rap book causin chess blade smoke
Minds the trunk, punk, elephant gun poke
Jaw-breaker humanoid vice-grip, choke
Face the inferno, maestro, pull it
Pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
Never, sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in
sweet action packed rap
Bite it, stomp on a beat
Posess hollow head battle teeth Tony Atlas
Wu status, now, wisdom to the masses

[RZA]
Cock back my tongue like a hammer, my head is like
a nickel-plated bammer, spit forty-five caliber grammar
At the speed of wind makes you bleed within
Crack your skull, without penetratin your skin
Reign of champ official, Wu scamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programmin fat tracks at Camp Cristal

[Method]
Home on the range, rebel with a pen
writin critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mista, Meth, Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my Sex Pistol, deal me in

[RZA]
The bewilderin killa bee quickly sting ya
I ain't gotta life one fuckin finga
Make sure to God I reef turns on the ringer
We duckin the subpeona
Fatal Flying Guillotine machine from Medina

[INS] Check the 150 millimeter, heater as it blows holes
[duo] through your fuckin speaker
[U-God] Makin you weaker creepin inches centimeters
[GZA] Fifty caliber street sweeper
Shots from Shaolin that go to Masapeaqua

[Method]
Things'll never be the same, after this one
Ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
Recognize the Gods came, for one accord
For one mind and one cause, that's the shit Son
Play them crows out position
You might hear me but you don't listen
Competition come and get some on
Red marker still bleedin, through the paper
of his sick premeditated, murder caper

[Street Life]
I walk with the Shaolin strut, burn a dutch
Watch Street eat em up, cold crush, bumrush
Spot rusher get touched backed up handcuffed
Y'all niggaz can't FUCK with us

[Ghostface]
Pass me the black velvet embassy suite killin me
Spell it Maxi Priest caught me in the days up on Delancy Street
Stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
It's like the dreads worshipin Jah, so ha-lo-ha
Pineapple crushed 850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spittin off the roof, holdin my change
Yo it's ragtime, universal 12 Monkey mind
It's like, stalkin through your airport [BZZZZZZT] with a chunky nine

[Street Life]
The undervolt Staten New York
Blood sport gun talk holdin fort back, take em to court ([Method:] One time)
It's the burner Shaolin bound facedown you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
Yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through midair
Landin thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron, where the head rest, for the conquest
Subway, wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
Matched up in a staircase, in a dark place embraced
by the trey-eight, I'm in so deep I can't escape
These crime situations, I stay in man formation
And shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
P.L.O., slam cats like Bam Bam, Bigolo
Throw a flow like Nomo relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro, hangin MC's by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno
"You will be punished (Wu-Tang style)
for all your evil deeds. (Wu-Tang style)
Be warned - you will suffer.. (Wu-Tang style)
.. justice!" (Wu-Tang style)

[GZA]
Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin it down they hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin niggaz wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style

(Wu-Tang style, Wu-Tang style!)

[Raekwon the Chef]
Yeah..
Aiyyo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most, innovative raps
that brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin, automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggaz, break down shoddy niggaz
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin darts
Flowin like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin through parkin lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks

[Method Man]
It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin in the woods
for the Clan's forthcomin
I miss you in the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
E'rything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin like Orville Reddenbacher
Potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin
and thinkin, "What's that SHIT they be smokin?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
[hach, spit] Y'all niggaz got some fuckin nerve
to critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass "Bye Bye Bye" knahmsayin?  I ain't playin

[Masta Killa]
Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains they sway
The words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
I walk water holdin y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the Gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potentcy, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski and spread glassy

[cut and scratch: "Wu-Tang style"]
[RZA]
Yo, yo one two one two, yo live in effect
We got the king Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah
Commonly known to y'all as the RZA
Yo before we go into side two or side B of this double CD
Knahmsayin I want to give y'all a little announcement man
For the last year there's been a lot of music comin out
the shit been weak, knowhatI'msayin?
A lot of niggaz trying to take hip-hop
and make that shit R&B, rap and bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin?
Or make that shit funk
Fuck that, this is MCin right here, this is hip-hop
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang gonna bring it to you in the purest form
I got the GZA on my side, Killah Priest
Sunz of Man, Royal Fam, Killarmy, Gravediggaz, 12 O'Clock
Yo, we want to let y'all niggaz know somethin man
To my people all across the world; Japan, Europe -- knowhatI'msayin?
Canada, knowmean -- Austria, Germany, Sweden
Yo, this is true hip-hop you listenin to right here
In the pure form, this ain't no R&B with a wack nigga takin the loop
Be loopin that shit thinkin it's gonna be the sound of the culture
YaknowhatI'msayin? (That player bullshit)
YaknowhatI'msayin? All that player dressin up
on this shit, actin like this some kind of fashion show man
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is hip-hop right here
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is lyrics, MCin
And yo, to y'all niggaz who think you going to become an MC overnight
YaknowhatI'msayin? Better snap out that fuckin dream
Man it takes years for this you Cat in the Hat ass rappers
You Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose, simple minded
(Stop runnin up on niggaz with all that wack shit)
Word up man (I'm talking about you MC's)
You ain't no MC; niggaz ain't made for this yaknowhatI'msayin?
This shit was Only Built 4 Cuban Linx -- we told y'all niggaz back then
And then everybody wanted to change their motherfuckin name
YaknowhatI'msayin? We come out with a style
Now everybody wanna imitate our style and all you producers out there
YaknowhatI'msayin? It's all good to show love to a nigga
But stop bitin my shit, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Come from your own heart with this shit
And all y'all MC's, stop biting from my niggaz
We told ya'll niggaz on the fucking Cuban Linx album
Don't bite our shit, y'all niggaz keep biting
Yo, I'm going to tell y'all something man
It's time for the Wu revolution right here
To all my niggaz across the world
Raise your motherfucking fist in the air
And get ready for the Triumph
Cause the Gods is here to take over this shit
Word up, peace
[Method Man]
Apocalypse Now
Mind over matter next batter be Tical
Put it on a platter how much uncut
raw shit we dealin wit, murder track what
Slang killin it, touched
You feelin it, in your bloodstream
deadly venemous elixir
Hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All and together now, follow me, the Mista
Meth Candyman, farewell to the flesh
Death come, in the scripture, two-thousand one
Bring the rap arma-gedde-on, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone
wit all that wack shit, now you know
you dead wrong, one thousand lashes

[Raekwon the Chef]
Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off, while ridin off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks, ani-maze
Somethin sheist like, seven butcher knives, rollin Rover style
twice, finger itchy like lice hair fell out somethin
to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanca
Toy Tonka truck ten carat on ya monsta
Ring Rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now FUCK Y'ALL act wilda
The style wilda than a praying mantis
Chillin like [long inhale]

[Masta Killa]
As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changin
the courses of time, devils no longer exist
as God Cypher Divine, all minds one no question
Now check it...
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might SHOT me a pussy protestin
Comin with that lip professin, you must take
Allah for fool, where's his Jewel
Was he usin Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist
You wishin you did the Knowledge before speakin
Seekin, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, mind arson, my squadren, surround the Sound-Garden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I, Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave, past the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a hairful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make you feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state

[Ghostface Killah]
Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent Range whippin soul controller of the lynch
Mackin phone rings, Stephen King trauma down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut jewels, wore no color shoe, knife annual
Moses lost his sandal, hidin the manual
Blow the vandal buggin off of Bon Jovi hits
Grammer lo-ve, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seize posin in Oshkosh, guzzle cries
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat, cause every word is choppy
My logic crunch all crows to death, Kobiyashi couldn't stop me
Gettin caught up in my world, Haagen-Daaz world
Backflip and then twirl, cave your whole world in
[gun blast]
[Intro: RZA]

Tiger style
Yo, huh, huh
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit
There's noplace to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
BAM! Aw, MAN! I SLAM
JAM, now scream like Tarzan

[Verse One: RZA]

I be tossin, enforcin, my style is awesome
I'm causin more Family Feud's than Richard Dawson
And the survey said -- ya dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin head
MZA who was that? Aiyyo, the Wu is back
Makin niggaz go BO BO!, like on Super Cat
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum!

[Verse Two: Inspectah Deck]

I puts the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pickup truck
Across the clear blue yonder
Seek the China Sea, I slam tracks like quarterbacks sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test, the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
and eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state!

[Chorus: RZA]

And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with
Straight from the motherfucking slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with

[Interlude: RZA]

Hyah!
Step up, boy!
Represent!
Chop his head off, kid!

[Verse Three: Method Man]

The Meth will come out tomorrow,
Styles, is wild, berserk, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Comin to a fork in the road which way to go just follow
Method, the Legend, niggaz is Sleepy Hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart comin on through
Niggaz is like "Oh, my God, not you!"
Yes, I, come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my
flava, comin from the RZA
which is short for the razor
Who make me reminisce true like Deja, Vu!
I'm rubber, niggaz is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you

[Chorus]

[RZA]
Ahh-hah! Yeah
Representin Brooklyn Queens
Long Island, Manhattan Bronx
The Rugged Lands of Shaolin
Niggaz from Virginia, Atlanta
Our boys in Ohio

Yo, niggaz from The Source

The whole Texas mob, the Chicago mob
Niggaz from Detroit, fuckin California squadron

Down in Maryland, all the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit
all over the whole fuckin globe, comin through boy
Peace to the fuckin Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths, word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, choppin heads boy
It ain't safe no more!
Peace..
[ODB + Snoop]

[ODB]
Your mama name Peter, papa name Cita
Fuck that nigga, when it come to the heater
Be the elevator, pussy eater
Too desperator, got shot, a hibernator
Hit a nigga later, he got to vacate 'em
Old Dirty corporata, splash, I'm up on the punanny flash
Bad gas, Macintosh, the light is red
Pee in the bed, I'm frustrated
For 29 years, no educated
High caded, cuz you kept it checkmated
What a waste, I'm up in yo' face like what
All you niggas I'm puttin you in your place

[HOOK with Snoop's "say what" at end of amateur...]

[Snoop]
Mr. No-Meaner, pussy ho-beater
I keep fo' heaters when I'm dippin with my vita
Suckers they wanna beat us, join us but we don't need 'em
Pump 'em and defeat 'em, dump 'em, and delete 'em
This negro right here pimps hoes
I smoke so much dope I have ya bloody at the nose
Since my buddy at these hoes wit a bud like a rose
It just so happens I'm the nigga that she chose
I flows above the rest, mos' def'
Got you shakin yo' ass, and you throwin up yo' set
Whatever you do, you keepin it true
Big Dogg and ODB, I thought you knew
Oooh, the Wu, is back up in this motherfucker
Oooh, and Snoop, is burnin rubber on these suckers
It's a dog day afternoon
The Clan go bang, and the bang go boom
How you love it, how you like it, and how you get it
Do that damn thing and quit buillshittin wit it
MC Conditioner, you could never say this boy is a amateur (say what)
MC Conditioner, you could never say this boy's a amateur

[HOOK]

[Snoop]

[BEAT SWITCH]

[GZA]
Yeah, pump that shit, testin
Check, 1,2, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes y'all, to my niggas y'all
To my click y'all, you can't quit y'all
Wu-Tang bangin' that dope shit y'all
That make you wanna roll up and smoke shit y'all
To the beat y'all, you can't sleep y'all
On my flow y'all niggas don't know y'all
You see my style calm but wild
You witness the rhyme, nothin but dimes
The eightball murder verse, freestyle or rehearsed
I wreck emcees whether I'm last or first
What, what, what, what, hazardous dart
Visual long forgotten art
That fell apart, til the blood ran from the heart
Pump through the street, Rza make re-break beats
Packed seats, rapid fire raps at off track meets
And an arm tank, high rank, heavy metal shank
Blow 'em off the plank when they ships approach the bank
Wu niggas rollin, throwin the first rap slogan
Heroes of Hogan, shot up the military clothin'
Quickly blow up, rolled up in rappers like pennies
My brother stack tracks on the behalf of many
With the wisdom, power of, science from experts
Self applyin, that put giants in the network
The compact disc and televised live cults
Will multiply our strength, on a worldwide note
Yes, what, what

[Deck]
Yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
You keep on, til the break o dawn
Ah yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
Ah Wu-Tang known to make your body rock
[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef]

Machine gun rap for all my niggaz in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flashback
See through yellow lines
Rock a fly jersey in the summertime God
Magic marker rap, bleed Benatton
Relaxed, wrote this, comin at cha crab ass cope
and snatch ya ice off, chillin in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feelin like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris?
Melodic single, dark snap a nigga just like fish
You fucked up, some rich niggaz you done test yo
Select the wrong apartment, and niggaz pulled up your dress
Style molest that, canal chain nigga where ya vest at
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hu-sane niggaz light the torch, we flamin niggaz
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggaz

[Chorus:]

[All] It's Yourz!
[RZA] The world in the palm of your hand
[All] It's Yourz!
[RZA] Twenty-three million of useful land
[All] It's Yourz!
[RZA] The seed and the black wo-man
[All] It's Yourz!
[RZA] Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
[All] It's Yourz! [2X]

[Verse Two: U-God]

Yo, super freak physique. like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf, everday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, now I ride with my swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lah smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble Ark builders God rush
Beams of light, stop ya breathin -- it's huntin season
Honey eye-ballin down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws, cause tonight
[All] It's Yourz

[Verse Three: RZA]

Stop the fader of the RAM, pass my watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blam
at full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag -- off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
with scissors in your hands -- bitch, the RZA
I stand close to walls, like number four the lizard
Enchant a few solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Randall McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

[Verse Four: Inspectah Deck]

It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact'll blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
explicit, I crystalize the rhyme so you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the Crooked I
No surprise, verbal stick up -- put em high
Rebel I, outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit, like bricks of C-4

[Chorus]

[Verse Five: Ghostface]

Check out my beaver, baby blue glock in the safe
Seems Darthy and the God and get ski roll weight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smokin estates, rhyme and power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court
for your birthday, the babyface of rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks rock the "W" and "Spiegel" books
Annheiser Busch kings came through, and stopped your whole jooks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearin the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room sheisty girl
Love to sit out this song, now watch your water break

[Chorus: latter 1/2]
[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yeah
Killah Priest
Iron Shiek comin back
Ready to attack
Freestyle
You know my energy get real hype in me
Yo

[Killah Priest:]
Move out my fuckin way boy you gonna get sliced
I seek revenge upon the earth like Christ
A mind is not called a rapture
It's more like a rap tour
Where niggas get cornered with a cracked jaw
I divide niggas like religion
End at abandonin' shit, tellin' mad lies to your vision
Burnin' me is invain and imaginary
You must be insane and fuckin' with mad theories
All niggas gash you, thoughts could match this
Got burnt, and return to mothafuckin' ashes
Your show is weak and your dead body corpses
My rap slew the youth like death and divorces
Now take em through the chamber, watch 'em feel the danger
Of a guillotine, this is how I kill a team
Don't scream bitch, have you ever seen an iller dream?
A nightmare, causin' you a slight fear
Come the omens 'til you fallin' through your right ear
Your eyes bubble, but there lies trouble ahead
Niggas are dead, you better cry double
Comin' it's that ill ass rapper with that sick ass
laughter (ha, ha, ha, ha)
You cannot escape the chapter
Once you try, then you feel the hooks
After you die, that's when I conceal the books

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Conceal the books, conceal the books
Overlook, conceal the books
It's you and I, conceal the books
And I'm out
KP the all mighty, the icon
Yea, it's that revived, revived, hip-hop
Gritty, this is real hip-hop
Untouchable, one love
[Intro: Miko the Pharoah (Christbearer)]
Yeah, North Star, what? (Yeah, ye-yeah)
(Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah) What? What? What?
(Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah) What? What? What?
(Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah) Christbearer
Ye-yeah

[Christbearer (Meko the Pharaoh):]
Christbearer make 'em all fall down
'Til they kneal and get the feelin, Motherless and Heaven-bound
(Heaven-bound)
Don't ask me why I chase the cat
Or do the dog-catcher with a rat 'til the dog spawn crack
Killa Beez attack with D's on the Lex and the cleavebacks
With Siamese macks (Long Beach)
Now girls, release the hounds
We impeach, that Caprice the ground (Yeah)
Beat up all dragons, but we unleashin now
Run the beast through towns 'til the beef is ground (North Star)
Now, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
And sweet baby James in the black flames
With the Carolina in my mind, searchin for a rhyme
Came back with the black sunshine
And fuck ya friends, all of them come and go (Yeah)
And they never come to see you when ya money gets low (Low)
Then let the record show that you could never love a ho
In debt to treat the baddest bitches like so-so (so-so)
I'm from the N-O-R-T-H where niggaz is forged to G cakes
With the three eight's, sedate, niggaz that caught a gate (What?)
See people make the world rotate
And I give 'em God in the flesh, the ass to test the vest
Stress and manifest success
I make 'em all say, "Yes", impress and address
The G.P. like L.S.D. (Uh-huh)
I'm a take you out way out (way out) where ya never been before
Into the coke and they laid out
Hittin California corners in the legs
Hittin Tony Romma's with the police on us (on us)
(One) And I don't give a fuck about the cops
With Mac in the peanut cups, spendin the high rise

[Doc Doom (Meko the Pharaoh):]
Gangstas make the world go round (Long Beach)
North town, Comp-town, puttin it down, Cali bound
We smoke, we joke, in the city of dogs and locs
Don't get ya pass revoked

[Shyheim:]
We smack niggaz like you and tell 'em, "Go get ya gun"
As far as I'm concerned you could suck dick and swallow cum
I'm God-son, the rose of salvation
Product of the ghetto, I'm the street's creation
I'm move like vampires, only at night
Hand grip like pliers on the glock with rapid fire
Goin haywire, I stab a nigga 'til my arm gets tired

[Solomon Childs:]
Thugz make the world go round, bloodhounds
Body Brighton town, Now Born town
Staple-town, Park Hill bloodhounds
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[12 O'Clock:]
I'm Brooklyn bound, I break ya ass down
Hardcore type sound that vibrates the whole ground
Around and around, where I stop, no one know
But if I'm comin ya way, best bet to get ghost
Champagne to toast, all cheers to this host
I rock coast to coast, any state that I approach
When catch the blast of a blunt of a Philly
I get crazy stupid, I got more bodies than Billy
The kid drops rhymes with a mind like Einstein
Never the swine, I love my family cause they mine
Check out my shit when I slam from my lips
It's never no riff cause my people come thick
It's 12 O'Clock in effect gettin wreck
See I pack a Tec if some beef on ya projects
Nevertheless, I rock and roll like Elvis
Stay fresh dipped from the feet to the pelvis
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[Christbearer:]
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Solomon Childs:]
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[Doc Doom:]
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Meko the Pharaoh:]
Meko the Pharaoh shootin down niggaz with black arrows
A soldier from the Wild Wild West
Rollin through city streets in a North Star vest
Funny niggaz get scared as fuck quick
Cause they man didn't learn to duck shit
Now that nigga's duck sick, from the flick of the wick
Media 'vict, deep shit
Women and man starts to happily flip
When I grab the mic grip, start tossin up shit
Y'all niggaz never thought North Stars would make it
Now ya gettin mad when ya girl starts to shake it
And Wu-Wear, the Wu-World Order
North Stars wet niggaz' ass like toilet water
Cause gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[12 O'Clock:]
Thugz make the world go round
Thugz make the world go round, world go round

[Christbearer:]
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Solomon Childs:]

[Monk:]
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round, world go round

[Intro: Shyheim]
"In Trouble"
Yeah, yeah, word, what?
"In Trouble"
That's my word, Allah
"In Trouble"
Get me out of this one, please!
"In Trouble"
I'll never do it again, for real
"In Trouble"
Word, somebody help me, it's real
"In Trouble"
Please make everything be ok
"In Trouble"
I'm in a well, I can't get out
"In Trouble"
I'm trapped, for real
"When you're down.. in trouble"
I'm tellin' you
"In Trouble"
Nobody gon' be there for you
"And you need some love and care"
Come on, I need you son
I'm tellin' you, you better listen to me
I'm your son and I love you
That's my word
Listen son, listen
Yo yo yo yo
For real, yo, yo, yo
For real, yo, yo, yo
I'ma keep it real, yo, yo, yo
I'ma keep it real

[Shyheim]
Three-to-six facin', new indictment
Plus violation of probation, I had to do the boogie oogie
Absent from court like class, I had to play hookey
The pressure was on, tippy tippy, I'm on my toes
Fuck risin' to the occasion, the temperature been rose
Set it off like intros, blast you and your kin folks
A trouble maker, bitcher taker, a scorpio
Naughty by Nature, my Unit brings the Flavor
We cake up like make up, and in New York
Fuck the daily news, Shyheim, I made the paper
Want a anchor and a lock, drop-top, three-and-a-quarter
My mother in Hell said, "People in Hell want ice water"
It'll be a manslaughter, private-eye, that's an order
I know where them cowards be standin', on the corner
Is it 'caine or money order? One love cousin
I thought it was when it wasn't, the dust had me
buggin'

[Break: Shyheim]
Pssh.. word up son
"When you're down, In Trouble"
When you down, they scatter like roaches
"And you need some love and care"
They be scared to death to pull them burners out them
holsters
Yo, word to my mother, I think they eat holsters
For real, son
But y'all I'ma bring it like, yo..

[Shyheim]
Yo, yo, yo
How the fuck y'all was thinkin'? Shyheim/Abe Lincoln
So what you ain't hear me on the Clan album, featurin'
At best I'm kept secretive like Mase and trees
Wanna hold me in captive in Babylon like Julias Maccabees
That's blasphemy, Shaolin'll blast for me
I eat niggas like plates, from Applebee's
Wu-Tang Killa Bees, we cause casualties
Collect annual fees, from y'all pussy-ass niggas
Who album should've come with a piece of gum and a tattoo sticker
A lot of my niggas, they've returned to the Earth
And in front of their hurse, I kick the same verse
Cuz everythin' the pastor said was fake and it hurt

[Break: Shyheim]
"In Trouble"
That's my word
Niggas don't be there for real
"And you need some love and care"
Word bond, all you get is a five-- five minute
conversation
Word, they like, "Yo, remember him?"
"In Trouble"
For real, "Remember them?"
Word up, son, man
"And you need some love and care"
God won't even give no flowers on your tombstone
I'm tellin' you, knowin' who is your homies
Niggas'll be stingy that you hang with
Uh, uh, uh..

[Shyheim]
When I was ten years old, I realized that with an O
I could flip that and bring back a brick in coke
Never took a short, never took a snort
Caught a warrant in New York for not appearin' in court
But I'll stilll survive, some of my closest homies died
Murdered in homicides, I just couldn't let it slide
Fuck money, jury and bein' a rap star
I hoped out shootin', soon as my bitch stopped the car
Plus Shyheim with the scar did it
That's what everyone said on my trial menace
They thought I was finished, but then I got acquitted
And pied niggas in their eye for the fuckin' spinach
Not for Olive Oyl

[Outro: Shyheim]
Yea, word, for real
This goes out to all my (spoiled) real peoples
"In Trouble"
Graduated, on the real, from the School of Hard Knocks
One thug to the last slug
"In Trouble"
To all my niggas, bein' out for the law
People that come and diss you, official Outlawz
Forms of snakes and all that
"In Trouble"
And all my niggas, man, suck a dick 'til you hiccup
Dugly, keepin' it bloody
"And you need some love and care"
Keepin' it real, Shyheim
To my whole family, Shy feel yo
"In Trouble"
We down, but we hold up, son
I'm tellin' y'all
"And you need some love and care"
For real, it's on, nigga
Yea, twenty-seven, we roll up the punches
"In Trouble"
Wu-Tang, we punch, mothafucka
Shaolin, Staten Island
"And you need some love and care"
"When you're down, In Trouble"
"And you need some love and care"
"When you're down, In Trouble"
"And you need some love and care"
[conversation continued from the end of Duck Seazon]

"The Wu-Tang Clan will rise again
There are many of us, working for the good of the Wu Tang"

"Die!" [sounds of fighting are heard]

[Verse One: Street Life]

So get your egg crashed, by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
like Kaity Chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched the horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead, before the age of twenty-one
Left his son to grow, in the ghettos of the slums
With a shot that go, for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow nigga and get, P.L.O.
By the lone gunner, who took revenge for his brother
who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawning, new crews is forming
Rival gangs warring blood steadily pouring
The streets are deep Son every day is like a rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But eighty-five percent uncivilized content
No tolerance so a lifetime is spent
behind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench
Killer instinct slave rap niggaz get lynched

[sounds of fighting]

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killah]

So yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slow footed penguins, ducking from these
hot rocks that's flaming, chocolate for all you rap Damian's
Spraying cards espionage, dodgeball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
and a mink in, next album 'Blood On Chef's Apron'
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats that book at Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a FUCK swatted bamboo
high school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out
on the regular for robbin a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, gringo throw the flows iglasa

[sounds of fighting]

[Verse Three: Inspectah Deck]

Ha ha ha ha, yo
What you know about this, specialist armed dangerous
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick technique split all your weak shit
Yes, the rhythm, the Rebel
Alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Living legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal weapon, step through your section
with the Force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, bit the mic sayanora
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword cross your throat you joke

[Verse Four: Method Man]

We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
when it reach out and teach someone, blaze they buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsing the sun, target practice
commence when I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your mattress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm going in
Shootin bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
blend like a chameleon
All these niggaz want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
We can go platinum but then, still can't get no satisfaction
Once again, back on the block crumb snatching
Blowing backs in cold
Blunted non-assassin, time for action, Johnny Unidas
Handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas

[swords clash]

[Verse Five: RZA]

Drownin' problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Gettin boosted off a killer bee pollen,
Stone columns get cracked by drum tracks
smack loud as gun loud as gun claps
pin a crab to death with a thousand thumb tacs
The Wu Sensai fold, it beez the Wind Ninja scroll
Sole edged blade controls your inner pole
The fig loot, fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber training new recruits
with Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team what it means
when bullets scream from the hot glock like rock from a sling
("Sometimes...") Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops
Shots get popped on the block causing blood to gush.
From digital to analog, the Wu-Wear camouflage
The entourage squad we stomping through Zanzibar
like herds of cattle, RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connect the Brook to Shaol like the Varrazano Narrow.

[Verse Six: Raekwon the Chef]

Stash the cream though, Iceatollah ice style gleama
Lex graffiti name reamer, hold em we rolling
asking me though, raps is hotter than, hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy that shit she passin off to me though
We wax Ajax niggaz with a axe, Maxamill
You could crash a meal, got you back steel
scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
sit back eyeing y'all niggaz out
Fakes that delegate we spittin fire out
Verb burglar, design the Wally shoe store reserve
a jet status, Guyanese all up on my mattress
Watch me mack this, Ralph Lauren goose inside a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Style enriched, resonate the waves with one change
Feelin mics like, wheeling a bike, slide like
step on his Klondike, get your dart right
We moving on it like, wind breaker niggaz get they face broke
Jewelry get snatched, magazine right on the low, fuck ya'll gats!

("Sometimes...")
[sounds of fighting]

"May you rot in hell!"
"Ahahahahah, ahahahahaha, ahahahahaha!"
[Hook: Madame D]
Woke up this morning, smoked some sticky green to get me started
Choclate thai, all in my eye, I'm never broken-hearted
Bang us in ya cars, bang us in ya Jeep, bang that shit retarded

[Intro: 12 O'Clock (RZA)]
(Bob Digi) Sun Zeini
(P. Sunn) 12 O'Clock
Two On Da Road on this (12 O'Clock)
I love my brother to death
(That old hip-hop, catch this)
(Hot Nix', you know? Big tits)

[12 O'Clock]
I love my brother to death, nigga pussy to the rest
Shared a pair of Guess and an Eddie Bauer vest
A bitch named Celeste
I met her when I was goin to cash a Def Jam check
She had some big ass breasts
I had to catch her like a shortstop on the Mets
A nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best
Remember grandmother live on Louis and Lex
I remember Dirt Dog crashed his white Lex
I remember me and Meth won a dice game against Ghost and Deck
Remember Portland had Clyde Drex'
Remember 12 O'Clock is a vet
Big Dogs we put 'em to sleep, keep 'em on a leash
I move like days in a week
Niggaz don't know the face and names on my teeth
Niggaz carry a cold piece, and separate the heat
Ain't scared of the motherfuckin police

[RZA]
Yo, yo
Guns jammed up, I'm cramed up in my lab
Six niggaz, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags
One toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic
And two niggaz hooked on pussy
And in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons
And learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson
Still cut class and played hookey
Threw freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies
Rolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks
Big forehead, had ears like Spock
He was mightier than a truckload of gats
And bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat

[Raekwon]
What up kid? Stay livin
Seen you look good, you look live in ya linen
And you survived ninth innin
The hood got us off the prop without women
All my niggaz that ride that provide to the end of this

[Madame D]
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Ain't nothin but the real
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Million dollar deals, rollin on Chrome Wheels

[Prodical]
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah (Ain't nothin but the real)
This one's on P. Sunn, word up? Yeah, uh-huh

We gamble the dice, remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life
While the we rumble with the foul and trife
Shots fired on the block in threes like Glen Rice
Made men think twice about the sacrifice
Black on white, write it for the world to hear
Write it for my fam who not here who do care
Glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
From the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums
Pedia Brown, media surround my sound
When you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound
Sample with black, criminal, mechanical rap
Assemblin hat, laced in a suit from Phat
Two On Da Road, got them bitches screamin, "Who Dat?"
Two with the plaques, two with the gats, it's like that

[Hook]

[Madame D]
Two On Da Road, Bobby Digital
He's a gangsta, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Live it up, live it up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Hook]

[Outro: Prodical *over Madame D's singing*]
Bang us in ya Jeeps
Shaolin! Bobby Digital
Uh-huh, Sunn who?
Yeah
Haha! Yeah!
Get that money y'all
Get that money y'all
Get that money y'all
Shout in pain
Uh-huh, yeah
Weed blazin, cocoa hazin, cocoa hazin
[Verse 1:]
In the battle fields mics collide like sword fights
Get stabbed up by the swift technique of a Black Knight
Who pierce strikes like vicious snakes, rhymes elevate
Niggaz get sniped watch me annihilate
The Gods got me eating off a fine dinner plates
With this rap shit told me don't procrastinate
West Coast lyricist, Killa Bee clique we swarm thick
Spit the written like scripts
No but fully loaded throw darts and make it hit, the target
Pardon, me as I keep on starting, mo' shit
Feel the wrath with these raw hits from Math
You don't stand a chance, you can't top it we too advance

[Verse 2:]
Sharp shooter with the greatest accuracy
Blast it rapidly, If those attacking me are after me
You never capture me, it's sad to see niggaz testing me
You meet your destiny can't get next to me
The best of me you know the recipe
The cut-throat making blood soak from the gun-smoke
Have you gasping for oxygen
Then pops you with the glocks again
Drop 'em in with the street life, the street type
We snipe, artificial niggaz under street lights
Street fights transform into wars with firearms
Bullets storm niggaz start to swarm like rise on
Dying on the same blocks when they exchange rocks
And hand cops flamed rocks
Year after year up in the same spot
Total madness synergy in city streets
Battle many fleets as they walk by the gates of the darkside

[Black Knights:]
Yo,yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 3:]
The microphone magnificent
Burning hot like syphilis
Hit your dish drink from distances
Bombin' leave no witnesses
The street division kid from the,
Home of the wasteland
Styles bionic, sounds blow holes through your basement
Face it for the Black Knights there's no replacement
You're basic, kid put this in your mouth so you can taste it
These ancient rhymes are lethal
When manifested bring wrath of bloody vengeance
to suckers that second guessed it
Confess it I got the type flows that'll make you stagger
Came out my mother's womb with a blunt and bloody dagger
From day one I knew that I'll be on some ol' lye shit
Do or die shit, ready to ride slug slide shit

[Verse 4:]
The audity prodigy,
The cosmos commodity, knowledge guides equality
A whiff while I myth and a sniff off a E&J fifth
and a spliff, the proton neutron,
Sally with the crouton dipping in the Yucon,
Supernova yoga, dosia, ambrosia crane and cobra
The yolk for help and the stealth with the knowledge of self
like no one else, the code of yoba
From the noble none of my niggaz local
[Intro: RZA]
Come on, come on
Yo, ye-yeah, ye-yeah
Where Ya At? Where Ya At?
Takin' it back to 1982
Runnin' Brownsville as we bring you (Where Ya At?
Where Ya At?)
That phat old school shit
The best of the troup could find
BOODOODOODOODOO!
Yo yo

[Chorus: Force MD's]
My crew is super duper fly and we came to get pai-aid
We pack those glocks and razor blades, duckin' spa-a-a-ades
Rollin' that sticky chocolate thai, we 'bout to get bla-a-azed
Y'all cats can't play with us, it's not a ga-a-a-a-ame

[Chorus: last two lines]

[RZA:]
Roll up the Winchester, pull my whites, that's the poindexter
Tell him bring back the black iron Mac strapped with two extra
Clips was a natural, worms in the Big Apple
Potholes in the street crack the Benz axle
Well let me come and descend my mens at you
You can't just catch this fish Jack mackarel
B-O-B boy, fast like Bruce Lee-roy
Caramel sundae honey set the decoy
For you soldiers seekin' to de-stroy
me, what the fuck you think we got the heat for?
You dunns, we knock out your gold fronts
Shorty got bigger and strong once she start smokin' blunts
With beef they get found in Hunt's
There's no chance to score, your best bet's to punt

[Chorus]

[Doc Doom:]
I know R&B niggaz that's harder than you
Young T.G.'s with more street smarts than you
Hit liq', shit you ain't got the heart to do
And I bet the click you run with they bustas too
Fuck a pass, we come strapped when we passin' through
All types of straps, you get clapped just for actin' new
Collectin' more guns ever since my cash done grew
Bad ass with no dash so I'm a bastard too
Ask your crew, nigga, I gay-bash 'em too
Grab his strap then ski-mask and bash 'em too

[Madam Scheez:]
West Cost rider, credit card slider
Roll up the windows and pass the lighter
I done turned into a lover, used to be a fighter
Now I pull out my guns and take 'em out one by one
You're a beautiful bitch, sittin' on pins and needles
I done seen bitches emotions breakin' up like The Beatles
Who's the real bitch now? Seen the fear in yo' tears
Now Tyrone folks is talkin', shut the fuck up here
A product of my environment until my retirement
Have a habit of the automatic breakin' up the static
And if y'all niggaz wanna trip y'all can suck my dick
I got eight or nine of 'em, different colors and shit

[Chorus]

[Timbo King:]
Smell like the rain forest, got diamonds in the hood - flawless
Sable Taurus, spit a verse, no chorus
You're on the wrong turf, one of my songs worth
two mil', eh-yo, red pill, blue pill
Still stay focused, off-white lotus, brokers
I'ma dead y'all slot time, no spins on the hot nine
Eh-yo, my hot nine got my whole block sign
I rhyme gangsta, pops was an O.G.
I'm a junior, my son'll be the third
Let 'em learn degrees, the bees and the birds (uh-huh)
Let 'em learn degrees, the bees and the birds

[Shyheim:]
Why you actin' cuckoo like you just flew over nest?
Like I give a fuck how much weight you bench
Shyheim, my government and my attributes
BIG left me the Tec and the nine at my crib, so Gimme the Loot
Or L.B.C. ya like Snoop, I'm out to get coof, again coof
Turn up the thermostat, peep the murder rap
'Bout to bring it back, in the name of crack
In the name of dope
Ridin' through the hood in the Diamondback with spokes
In the name of thai, cliches and skunk
I came to get high, came to get drunk
I came with the Tec, Bobby came with the pump
We left with the shines, left with two dimes
Sittin' on dubs, royal flush, five of a kind
Countin' the spare for the deuce-ooh-ooh-one
Nigga, our year, niggaz, our year

[Freemurder:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, talkin' all drunk, makin' a rap right here
Fool remainders, like he can't get clapped right here
Fuck the walkin', Freemurder pack right here
On some napalm and bamboo track right there
Fuck twenty-five, shit, I'm strapped to the chair
Cuffie Crime Fam', my fifth black in the air
Y'all don't want none, lead ya back down the stairs
Once the Mac appear
Four heat, I ain't hit 'im, shoot back fire wit 'im
Whole empire wit 'im, never plea guilty, I ain't hit 'im
Guess who lyin' wit 'im
Left po', ya dead broke like Holy's ear when Tyson bit 'im
Still on point like lime segment
Pull out joints, the nine wet men
Double action, don't want no trouble, askin'
"Who I be?", Murder like Tai Chi
Get ya brain tilt
New Yorker, Brooklyn is where he come from

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh) Spin

Rakeem Allah (I see you nigga, the God is here)

Yo, straight through the doors out the car (Huh?)
Swarmin, me and my mans towards the bar
He like, "None of that white stuff"
"Cognac, 'Perb, none of that white stuff"
When I smiled at here, it's like my breath was froze
She all up in my clothes, see my necklace froze
"Miss, I don't stand next to ho's
'less we runnin a train and I'm next to Ghost"
I'm hearin whispers, ain't that 'Perb from Floor City?
Cop the Cris', eight times $4.50
Fuck disco lights, I'm the disco sight

And y'all broke boys is just horny pigeons

Serve her cheese steak, let her cash her cheque
Feelin me faith 'til I cashed that cheque
Hoped out my vet, blast at that
Hoped out my coffin, laughed at Rev
Play the CD, my ass ain't dead
No needles, left that, I was a dusthead
See I don't touch death or discuss death
Don't open no mail, I don't trust fans
Just bread, and we eat from the mess hall
And you can call Brooke Shields, tell her post bail
Cuz I murdered niggas on the Ghost album
It was charged for arson cuz I roast rappers
On a broke ass stove with no matches
Wearin old ass clothes on no mattress
Now we hit Reggie Jacksons with no practice
And 'Perb did movies, he ain't no actor
I'm a Far Rock gangsta, I ain't no rapper
Tell the truth, I only know broke rappers
Ghost put us on when he went cold platinum

[Chorus: Lord Superb]
Spin, Spin, Spin (Get money, nigga)

[Chorus x4]
[Kardinal Offishial]
Hey yo somethin in the Dot went BANG BANG
Uh-huh the T-Dot went BANG BANG
Hey yo Somethin in the Dot went BANG BANG
Word up the T-Dot went Bang
Let's Go.. yo yo yo aiyyo
FIYAH on the government, FIYAH pon Babylon
FIYAH pon this corrupted land on which we walkin on
Ice grills melt into a puddle in the struggle
Niggaz try to bust back but get juked by undercovers
You wonder why so many niggaz out there sellin crack
because police allow that
They add that to their paper stack, aiyyo
People are you ready, YO, are you really ready, YO
Many need to know about ghettos in the T dot O
The news people try to pretty up the scene
but my peoples gettin killed out there, seen? (SEEN!)
None of y'all niggaz can talk about peace when
Palestinian youth throwin rocks at police
In the street we talk shit, a lot of young punks with guns
with dollars while the ghetto yout's have no funds
The devils in this world always dress up as nuns
Kardinal Offishal, fire starter volume one..
CAREFUL

[RZA]
Wait, hold up, chill, what's that son?
Damn.. nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point sun
Hold tight grip on the +God-U..Now+ you best be careful!
Can't dodge two (??) aimed at your domepiece
+Father-U-C-King+ police!!

[U-God]
Somethin in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Somethin in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum

[Masta Killa]
Yo Rae it's been a long time son since we bust
Gunclap +Glaciers+, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B., on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a Masta!!

[Cappadonna]
Yo somethin in the street went, BANG BANG
Makin it hard for you to do your THANG THANG
Somethin in the street went, BANG BANG..

Up in the boss game wildin, money for grabs
I ain't fuckin with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave.
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryin to re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggaz in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggaz you can't trust, dealin with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James

Somethin in the street went, BANG BANG
Makin it hard for you to do your THANG THANG
Somethin in the street went, BANG BANG
Makin it hard for you to do your THANG THANG

[Ghostface Killah]
Somethin in the hole went (Click Click)
The boxcutter went (Click Click)
Somethin in the hole went (Click Click)
The boxcutter went (Click Click)

These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, razoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
to Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was coppin 6 G's
Begosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers

[U-God]
These (??) camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, ways, of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a hoe stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?

[Inspectah Deck]
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK

Made 'em throw they hands up, but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop backs that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhymin hero?  Wu-Tang rules again

Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK

[Myalansky]
This goes out to all my cats in the projects
Just livin it, still livin it
Thru the rough times and the bad times,
the crimes, where was heaven
Must be somewhere here, though, for real
I never seen the place
Maybe some place you got when you die

An ordinary cat from outer projects, since I was younger though
Mom raised her children, pops dipped a long time ago
In my mind I see flashbacks, I had no fancy clothes
Skinny, ugly, knotty head nigga crying with a snotty nose
Even though my father neglect, he pay the child support
Hadn't seen him all these years, I hug his ass in court
Always saying I'm comin to get you and I be waitin too
Holiday and birthday presents was never comin through
Remember at the age 13 I started smokin weed
Hanging out with cats that was older, start to run the street
Dropped out of high school selling drugs, impressin chicks
Spent most my cheddar on gear, my man was buyin whips
New York, Jamaican, Miami niggaz, flooded Virginia quick
Cause signin work only if buying, prices was high as shit
Remember when I first got hit, I seen the iron spit
50 cash bent in one corner bleeding where pellet hit
My man Shawn, he held on strong
Slug burn through his lower back side, crack his spine exit his arm
Lost him twice on the hospital table and when he died I cried my eyes out
I couldn't take it (damn damn), but the same things continued to happen
Niggaz got bust, I'm a kid with a grown man's mind turning corrupt
Playing innocent in front of my elders
I was running with them cats that be robbing too, I couldn't tell 'em
If my name was up in any type trouble, my moms would tell me
Just like you brothers into some shit go get a job or something
Just a little bum on the street, not working hard for nothing
Scratch I made when I was pumpin, I'm here to offer somethin
Making sure the crib stay tight, for real I wasn't no dummy
Tell me where you getting this money, I wash a car be lying
Saying anything 'sides drugs selling, my sister seen me on the block
Transact' with fiends, be saying I'ma tell it
Growing up was hell no doubt, I wonder where was heaven

[women singing in the background]

Shit, it's like yesterday, you know?
It all comes back though, but still
But still livin on the block, but still fucked up
You know? Crime affiliated, Crime Syndicate
Whatever you wanna call it
You know what I'm sayin? Affiliated with the bad shit
All the time just cuz I'm a victim of the projects

Now I'm a grown man, still It's like life dealt me the wrong hand
Cat's that was my man be frontin' or either found dead
Sound said incarcerated just turned a new Dad
Remembering them long ten months from slingin crack bags
Mom put me out with the quickness, carry your black ass
I'm still coming back to the crib, oh so you back? yeah
Ma' I just came to holler to see how you doing
Nothing's changed after all these years
Still hustle for some gear, smoke weed, still drink beers
I tell you from my heart, yo, 'times I'm like yeah

[women start singing again]

I wonder if heaven was a place in this planet
You'd find me right there.

Where was heaven.
[Raekwon]
Yeah, yeah
I see everything
I see everything
YouknowhatI'msayin?
It's like when we come through
You better have your fuckin third eye open
You know, cause thats what time it is
YouknowhatI'msayin?
Cause it's like, when you walk
You striving for perfection
That's what we doing
Understand?
So all that little fake shit out there
We know the science on that
We done seen that shit from, from
From difference of angles
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, yo kid, for real
Wu-Tang, we set off a lot of shit in this shit kid
YouknowhatImean?
But you know, you know us
We play it calm, humble
YouknowhatImean?
But I just be checking out niggaz darts and I be like
Damn, them niggaz, them niggaz is
Really, really, really, really, really
They gonna stay shit!
Uh ha, uh ha ha
YouknowhatImean?
But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller
YouknowhatImean?
Rather I say we the soul controllers
The bottom line, like I said
Deal with freedom, justice, equality
You know?
Keep shining, add on
Food, clothing, and shelter
All my niggaz, go pick up uniforms
Go, when you buy this album
Go pick up uniforms, for real
YouknowhatImean?
Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody
We doing this shit for certain niggaz kid
Certain people rather, certain
Certain fans, certain supporters
Certain delegators, word
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these
Fake ass niggaz fucking, running with the fucking globe
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the
Way it, it should really be seen
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics
Spread it right
YouknowhatImean?
[Intro: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
What up, G, what up G? Why you knockin' on the door?
No, you can't come in, heh, you can't come here
Yeah, the key don't work no more, yeeh
You fucking around, yeah you smarter than me
You smarter than me, hee-hee

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
I don't know, who now, how do it feels since you
No longer have connections, with me, you dumb in
Hungry and found this, you must be, your plan is vaulted
You don't wanna play a game, it only works when you young and beautiful
Now you should know - how neither of these herbs gassin' you
That would have you boosting clothes
Left you hanging, dry and stupid though
So know it's your turn, to play what you give for
Your brain's looping slow, you stupid hoe
Yeah, you should know, but the foolish don't
You don't get too close, cause you know the truth will show
Runner ability, see, is something I went through before

[Interlude: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
Yeah, yeah... I seen this movie before, it's weak
The plotline is very thin
Yeah, it lacks substance, very predictible
I give it a thumbs down, I give it a thumbs down

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
See, I studied psychology since a young'n
So I spot every move, you make
I may not see it clearly through all the street talk
You got beef, walk, yeah I love you, but not like that
You try to stop my act, with your high for looting, childhood retribution
It won't rest til you get, your licks in
Vixen Victoria's Secret stories, you keep within
Your witch's brew, for due -- you
Fancy as a, not too shroud, denial you choose
But your eyes on the glue, to your inner most
And, when I'm host to your bizarre sideshow, then expose for you

[Interlude: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
Yeah, cause remember the wicked witch
When she looked in the mirror, and then the mirror just shattered and shit
Cause she was so ugly and shit... but ugly in the inside though
See you don't dig me, when I'm saying that
You gotta feel me, when I say, that that's the wicked witch

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
You seem lost so why would you try deviating
From what would seem to be, the clear choice to making
Such a situation, such as this, now wake up
I play possible with you, but you gotta do what I say
But you gutter babe, through and through, you ain't have enough yet
Pushing pussy for product, having a good time is what you call it
All of it, washed away the mourns of an alcoholic
Now you out for my wallet, and give me a hard time too
Just to show me a thing or two, about, how low the low be
Well don't get cold feet, when you discover I hold heat
To melt that cold heart, that's so weak

[Outro: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
You know... it ain't nothing but a thang
See, um, if you start, um, doing something stupid around here
I'mma come out there and I will beat a bitch ass
I will beat a bitch down to the ground
And, I might have to get some paper though
Cuz, since you out here already fucking other shit
Youknowhatimean, but, you ain't nothing though really
That's you though, you know?
[Intro: The Genius/GZA (from "Clan in Da Front")]

Niggaz on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggaz on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what

This goes back to nineteen..
Ahem, check it, yo
GOOD MORNING VIETNAM!!
Yeah, good morning to all you motherfuckin notty-headed niggaz
Word to the camoflouge large niggaz
Bitch niggaz fuckin my body
Bring that fuckin meth in here
Yo yo yo yo
Now we gonna drink some good Nightrain

[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef]

Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit DOWN
As I come and freaks the sound, hardcore
but giving you more and more, like ding!
Nah shorty, get you open like six packs
Killer Bees attack, flippin what, murder one, phat tracks
A'ight? I kick it like a Night Flite!
Word life, I get that ass while I'm fulla spite!
Check the method from Bedrock, cause I rock ya head to bed
Just like rockin what? Twin glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, we going to war right now
So, yo, bombin
We Usually Take All Niggaz Garments
Save ya breath before I bomb it

[Verse Two: Method Man]

I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggaz save the beef on the cow
I'm milkin this ho, this is MY show, tical
The FUCK you wanna do? More than Spike Lee's Do
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO style, buddha monks with the owls
So who's the fucking man? Meth-Tical
On the chessbox

[Verse Three: Inspector Deck]

Yo, yeah, yo
I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost, like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material, made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspector, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic
Representing with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like an ear
The zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
Armed and geared cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system - for murdering the rhythm!
Now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin charge when I explode

[Verse Four: Ghostface Killer]

Slammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fastin, quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox!
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die
My seed'll be ill like me
Approachin me, you out of respect, chops ya neck
I get vexed, like crashing up a phat-ass Lex'
So clear the way, make way, yo! Open the cage
Peace, I'm out, jettin like a runaway slave

[Verse Five: Prince Rakeem/RZA]

Yo
Ya gettin stripped from ya garments, boy, run ya jewels
While the meth got me open like falopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig Zag, Zig-Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel
Suspenseful, plus bein bought through my utensil
The pencil, I break strong winds up against your
Abbot, that run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics

[Verse Six: Ol Dirty Bastard]

Are you, uh, ah, uh
Are you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurah
The Ol' Dirty Bastard VUNDABAH
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that PISS!
Niggaz be gettin on my fuckin nerves
Rhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb
I got funky fresh, like the old specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, and THEN DROP THAT SCIENCE

[Verse Seven: Genius/GZA]

My my my
My Clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer
Style jumped off and Killa, Hill-er
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like getting smashed by a cinder block
Blaow! Now it's all over
Niggaz seeing pink hearts, yellow moons
orange stars and green clovers
[Intro: Ras Kass]
Uh, Dreddy Kruger, what up, my nigga?
Yeah, GZA, you know, uh, Rassy, you know
Shouts out to my nigga Wreckonize, all my MIA

[GZA:]
Formed in very a strong advanced post, east to west coast
Ahead of time, competition not even half close
Let's say, by no means, an equal value
Prematurely brought to play, I'll never allow you
To strike first, so precautions must be taken
And what's worst? When you're just fronting and faking
It's a shame when the sixteen bars are just a waste
And every line or word, is badly placed
Even dealing with the narrow window of time
My arrangements, are quick, shutting down your power lines
On a bunch of small puppets, with a wack ass team
That only move, at a push of a button that pull strings
Bad boys move in silence, secretly fading in
Unlike fake gangstas and ya wannabe made men
Acting like they carry the gun that killed Lincoln
Or they rolling with two hundred murderers from Kingston

[Ras Kass:]
Our goal is to learn y'all niggaz, about this new world order
But I'm still try'nna run up in the president's daughter
He the auditor, ain't let the NARC's see this barker
Stick to bitches walls like I'm Peter Parker
The Vida Guerrera sidekick hacker
Five niggaz licked, on the Internet jacked her
Dog, I'm not a rapper, I'm the black Dracula
Nosferatu, spitting darts at you, out of black Acura
Homies is gat packers, rat packer
Fly nigga, I'm the Benjamin stack attractor
Mack attacker, pimp slapper, the track cracker
Epitome of nice, after Rainbo press the lacquer
And y'all niggaz is a waste, like fat chicks with little tits
If your names not YKK, then get off my dick
Bitch, I hang with the trillest, and that's why 5 percenters,
College kids and ex- felons feel this
I'm sick with the words, Waterproofing Liquid Swords
The world never heard this before, call me Mr. More
Cause more money, more murder, and more spit to serve
[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, yeah yeah now, what the fuck now?
Flipmode Wu-Tang shit, what the fuck now?
Yeah yeah yeah..
Historical and monumental shit
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall
Niggaz play hard and shit; if you know what's best for you
y'all niggaz better safeguard your shit
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap
Street niggaz now the corporate boss
Still go to y'all resteraunt for steamed fish and Irish moss
And y-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb
Your whole show wack and I'ma cancel your sitcom
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm
You ain't knowin my name tattoed on your bitch arm
The way we blow SHIT is a shame
Casually bust my gun and celebrate bustin a cork on the champagne
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggaz
Y'all should know I only ball like a coach, NOW!

[Raekwon the Chef]
Check out the light fixture, freak lines like white bitches
Let the mic lines - hang that slang is ridiculous
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed-offs
That's my specialty, more to bust
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry
S-5, blowin through Asbury
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin like makeover thousand
Them them niggaz, robbin from Pinkhouse's
Show and prove, knockin off cab drivers
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses
Limousine, automatic new uzi's in 'em yo
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him

[GZA]
Move up the block, giant box blast my song
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on
Doo-rag hang long, metal tape is high-bias
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in
Some assumin they paid dues and joined the union
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant
was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise
Starlight scope, with the night vision device
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice
[GUNBLAST]
"Execute them" [x4]

[Street Life sample played in the background]
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap
Might lose your eye sight, blood type, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to right the hype"

[Raekwon:]
Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Check this Slovak lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, tibble and cold war
Hailin from my neck down, rounds flip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dry a hitman for hire, alien flyer
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up

[Masta Killa:]
Aiyyo witness the abduction, bill of destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
Acknowledge shorties bustin, but they gotta come son
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
Peace Sudan, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Floor lies dough, wit a c-note, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as command in chief
Mad thorough, competition's intense for every inch of the borough

"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap" [x2]
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"

[Inspectah Deck:]
Murder verser, twenty bean rap fiend server
Rhymes nurse your mind, bustin like twin burners
Certified lah, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, ?damn's fly? the rest
They bettin contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off

"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" [x2]
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
I live to write the hype
[Raekwon]
Hang glide for my nigga Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)
Right that's my word, guaranteed you're dealin with the invicible (no doubt)
That's my word, Persian legacy one time, one time
Check the science of the black man
Stationary niggaz, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggaz to sleep this year

Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas, name your God Ukarema
Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me jury cleaner, Million Man March screamers
Rae Cartegna, cut your joint Wolverine
The lonzina, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino
Yo Bobby Robby whattup, Max tried to follow me
Sadaam loungin, clean up collect, like the laundry
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line
Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her
Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements
are launched like lead projectiles, straight out the basement
I suplex your rap, left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx
My hip-hop, swarmin team locked inside the detox
Under key flock, it's like b-block and E-glocks
you're ill, your trail end thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows with the transistor
Kinetic globes light will then shine, burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, I be self lord and master

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides
FUCK you dissastified the double dyed black brown I advise

[U-God]
Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, snatcher batcher went to fresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dumb be clapped, mummy wrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Damer sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut
A can of ass whoopin flurry shake, break you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin hooks
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book
This deathbent doctrine, paper for the youth
what remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth

[CappaDonna]
Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite, satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man
workin hard for the grand, I understand clear
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like jaws, you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
Wu article CappaFive, CD attack
but my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold dangle, never make me throw darts
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts
[Verse 1: Ruthless Bastards]
Check it, these cold days got me in a physical rage
Walking through the dark path in this invisible maze
My individual is criminal but lyrical plays
A big part in my life in this critical state
Apocolypse, twist up the bamboo
Swine life I cant handle
Cock the mack candle, pop the Jack Daniels
Im a shine like candles in a blackout
Your guaranteed to fall before the last bout
Fuckin wit Ruthless you assed out
The size of these guns a make you pass out
Im like hollow tips the way I blast out
Its all revolving, too much problems, no solving
Ask me what Im involved in, Im a say robbin and mobbin
Im runnin this shit nigga joggin
No thanks for livin on Thanksgiving Im still starvin

[Verse 2:]
Yo, Im not new to this, Im true to this
What you gonna do to lips?
Man if I tell you one more time Ive been doin this, mound u loopbp
Ruthless be wettin these clowns up
Yo partner turn that sound up
Reverse the crowd round up
And this one, new on the block just like a rookie
Frontin like he hard dunn he mustve ate some thug cookies
No evidence plus I heard his clique be on that tellin shit
You let him sell a bit so bustin hims irrelevant
Just get these presidents, the reallest thing man lust
Once the papers in my hand its like I got a roush
Aint gainin trust, cause man I aint tryina get bust
Run for cover, pull a trigger, watch em all turn to dust
A ribbon in the sky, I watched his mom dukes cry
Too bad her son had to die for startin up the two four five
Guns never lie, chains like slaves go but heavy
Down in my belly, attatched to my waist is a celly
For plannin funerals and gettin niggas buried
I wanna lead this life but I can hear it callin me like R. Kelly

[Verse 3:]
Shoeless shine like sunny days
My style on the loose like runaways
Its crazed in the battle get you open like a bag of purple haze
When hell get fucked up
Cant hang slow the fuck up, I represent Staten
Push my buttons you get stuck up
I love thick bitches so ooh keep your ass shakin
I be money makin, In nive seven I like em taken
Fuck fakin wilden and breaken, in the club gettin my groove on
The gat in my Tims just incase you wanna move on
Been off the Bacardi to Moe
Slayin this chick off that keeps sweatin my body so (who can love you like
me)

[Verse 4:]
Sagoddi, swingin tux wit wallys
Yall niggas dont wanna try me
For them presidents by now Ill leave you dead
Filled up wit hot lead, hollow heads for you thug breds
Its the righteous, life is trifeless, challenges and sacrifices (tell em son)
Ruthless cause we flip tracks, pack gats, and give slices
A poor heistess, you think your nice now meet the nicest
Son a actress, stick him like a cactus, bouce like a matress
Teflon fatigues if you try to wack this
You aint know it was cold on these streets
Only time its warm dunn when I got the heat
Drag my knicks and five eights, I need a gimick to compete
Triggas, Im squeazin em at the crossroad Im leavin em
They got the guard locked I got knocked so I could be wit them

[Verse 5:]
Attack wit tactics, thats fantastic that for realah
Throw me cuts to chop the beat wit your five claws
Create tracks that blow the hinges off the doors
Thats all I can stands and I cant stands no more
Whirlwind mind spins off Seagrams gin
Started all over and dont know where to begin
Extreme measures got my thoughts on gettin pleasure
These cats know that I clap holes through they leather
Statens sick and we cant get no better
Police trap, we get away too clever
Lyrics jotted down on paper causes terror-
Ism, now im gone hit em
Give em what we been givin em, thats the rythem
Staight up, all you crab niggas sleepin need to wake up
Im like peroxide cause I stay bubblin in the cut
Nigga please, Im thirsty for this cheese
I run up in your lab and make your anti freeze
Its like that, from the Stat where I live at
The bees are snakes and they just feed off the fuckin rats

[All:]
If im a bastard then your a bastard
Everybodys a bastard
Get the gats cause shit is drastic
[x5]
God damn man these radio station be buggin
Man it's three o'clock in the mornin, damn
This hip-hop shit just keep
Damn we got to slow this shit down man, yaknowhatImean?

[Tekitha]
Fiends were never waiting in the hill
They ran one step ahead
But the jiggy was always there

Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress

As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then suddenly in the sky

Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the ear
With the melody of a train (Lord is suddenly here!)

False MC's are melting
In the dark, all the weak LP's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn

God released the tape out, early May

And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress

Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the air
With the knowledge that God posess

As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then the Wu-Tang sign appears, in the sky

Billboards started melting
In the dark, all the weak MC's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwn

God released the tape of, Earthly pain

And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme

And I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmmmmmme

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Twenty-five to lifers, true and livin snipers
You wait like "Sixth Sense" 'til hard to kill

[StreetLife]
How you livin StreetLife?  I'm surrounded by criminals
Serial killers tote guns without the serial
High-tech, street intellect, all digital
Project original, sheisty individual

We hall of famers, and still hit you with the greatest
Took a year hiatus, now you wanna hate us
Thanks to all you haters for all the cream you made us

[Chorus]

[Raekwon the Chef]
Sendin letters to (?), my cousin in Wendy's on Viacom

[Method Man]
We can eat right, or we can clap these toys
I'm with StreetLife, ain't never been a Backstreet Boy
Who y'all kiddin?  Tryin to act like my shoe fittin
Confused with ya head up yo' ass like who's shittin?
It's Hot Nixon, same team same position
Battin average three-five-seven and still hittin
Y'all still bitchin, still lame and still chicken
I'm still here, one leg missin and still kickin
Cause I'm haaaaaaaaaaaard!  Hard like a criminal
Love like a tennis shoe, throw slug to finish you

[Chorus]
[U-God]
Hard days of work
You had a hard day at work baby
I want you to sit down, relax
While I soak you in my mentals
Backrub style, watch this, yo, yo
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears
Cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair
So lather the soap, coconut conditioning
Honey lather, blood flowing, love glistening
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers bun scrubbers
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbing
These will splash long loving in your oven
Make it off, break it off, till it gets soft
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off
In and out, rapers patients, Hershey's Kisses get a style
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out
Brain message, think about pink
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play
Back rub, count on, take me away
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish
Come with me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea
You and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees
Jet skis breeze
Scraping water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers
Vapor action, tropical sunshower
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace
Complete silence, what surround us
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat, loop played jazz music, coffee pillow sleeps
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
Sunset level, suprise sunrises, hell
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell
Violin, good medicine, sound swell
Sunshine like, the right, without the hell
Taste sugar, wise storm steam stick
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
Company, ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies
Soon, taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, prize storm
Now it's high noon, rasberry spices
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war
Paradise life, recipe now pour
Musicness, model, gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow, fantasy Allah
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty
Yo, this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass that
Know what I mean?
Massaging these melodies
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds, blow, through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit
Right right

[Method Man]
When your around boo
Come and chop this mother fucking beat you stank ass trick
[Intro: 12 O'Clock (Sandman)]
Two On Da Road right here
(Uh-huh, somethin for the radio, nigga)
Two On Da Road
Uh, Two On Da Road

[Chorus x2: Sandman - singing]
When you see me at the party homey get at me
And don't be mad when your girl try and spit at me
Cuz when the beat got doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
It ain't no limit to the things that we can do

[12 O'Clock:]
I'm at the bar, Long Island Iced Tea
Double shot of Hennessey for this pretty piece
with pretty feet smellin like Victoria Sec'
I could see her bra and panties were pink
Lookin Spanish or Greek, finest thing I seen all week
Movin with her cousin and niece
I'm movin with my mans Monk and P
Stand at the wall, long chrome 3-3-3
Pussy for free like ODB, high off the eves
Bitches lookin like Pamela Lee
Butt-naked on their hands and knees
Roll up the trees, burn somethin 'fore we leave
Give your friend your car keys, slide with me

[Shyheim:]
Peace
Hey vagina, use my name Davey Crocket
I'm king of the wild frontier, your sex hostage
MMMMM.. Mr. Lover-man, what's cookin good lookin?
Let's jump in the fryin pan, fuck yo' man
He don't want it with us killas
With E-40 Skrilla, for real-a

[Doc Doom:]
Bottle for the Wu years and I'ma hit the flow after a few beers
Just tell the DJ the Black Knights is up in here
Wu-Tang is in here, the whole Killa Bee Gang is in here
and ladies holla when we in here
cuz they know it's Big Pimpin goin on in here
and in the VIP, ho's take it off in here
So get at me cuz I know you wanna spit at me
and I'd be a fool to let that fat ass pass me

[Shyheim:]
You wanna ride in the 600 BAAA-BAAAY
with your head out the window like "HEY HEY"
Tell everybody in the hood you my LAAA-DAAAY
We big up for life so you crazy

[Prodical:]
This killa dog puffin green gandy, ready to sink through some panties
Caught some eye candy, sippin on Coke mixed with Remy
Yo Monk, shorty got a lot of junk in her trunk
Now she surfin through the crowd for our weed and skunk
A nigga 12, droppin treasures like the jewels of the Nile
Twenty-seven, ManChild from the Isle of Shaolin
We sky Sushi bar, Meoshi par, finest cigars
and the ladies in the place wanna know who we are
Gumah Oz Dubar, my hand all in her bra
So what's the deal ma'? Can me and my Clan Bar Mitzvah?
Call your girlfriends, after-party, house on the hill
Come and do real, she said "I'm burnin heart off the pill"
Drinks for free, I got my own VIP
Two or three, or it can be just you and me
Let's get it on and poppin, crack-a-latin with no debatin
No time for the fakin, baby girl what's shakin?

[Monk:]
Catch Monk in the midst of party crackin, don't dance
but I boogie to the beat low key, I stay splashed
And drunk still drinkin, poppin major with the ho's, I'm groovin
with this fat bitch, she stuck with my slang and my dresscode
I got close, whispered "What's up with the Bar Mitzvah?"
Then I grabbed her ass, she laughed with a porno look
and pussy popped her ass on rhythm with the beat
But passed, she with her man but her friends came two cars deep

[Chorus x6]
[Verse One: U-God]

Yeah, yo
Give me the cue
Skip the introduction, prosate the lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people bustin weed
Splatter your belly like some Attica fellas
Use a firearm good, bloods go for hard swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty hurt has them
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine, Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Bejing
When we touch down you crown renowned kings

[Verse Two: Method Man]

There's no honor amongst theives, street pharmaceutical
Stack like Genovese, the four devil tempt mad men
But not these, we profound hardcore sound
To MC's thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggaz gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty
And spread fear through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stairs
The smell of fear makes my nostrils -- flair, truth or dare
Ask yourself can you compare
to these niggaz in the hood, Johnny B. Goode
or he be gone, yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
P.L.O. from here to Lebanon, how many bombs
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news, from Meth-Tical

[Verse Three: RZA]

You gots to be kidding, you gots to be kidding
Aiyyo kid, you gots to be kidding, my glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding, yo

It's common sense how I master my circum-fer-ence, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang harvest one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay high as like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose pedals
Arresting and holding, penetrate for better regions
Wack MC's only lasted one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, yo, we propose our
aim the official, initial, is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissable
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to a keyboard is true hip hop set tangible
illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain Unforgettable, like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Throw chairs to deck a skyscraper
Understand that the continents of Africa and Asia
and free the black man from the enslaved labor, Wu-Tang

[Interlude: Masta Killa, Method Man, Raekwon]

The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nuttin
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang

Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak the speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is

[Raekwon conversating with some people]
"All you been seeing is upsets in the box and shit right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfuckin Whittaker"
"Dang, he caught Whittaker"
"Mmmmhmmm"
"He caught Whittaker a long time ago"
"Mike got touched"
"Then Mike got touched by Holyfield"
"Holyfield"
"Yeah, word up"
"Hey, Mike's -- Mike's gonna forfeit this fight"
"He ain't fighting McDermit"
"He ain't fightin?"
"Nope"
"Whattup?"
"You talkin bout he -- what he, what he, what he did?"
"Told them he cut his eye, in sparring"

[Verse Five: Ghostface Killah]

Style adoral rap pressing, David Berkowitz
Einstein birth to hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gens
Purified cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang throw me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hangin off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker, marvel cake stakes admissor
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, youse a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, soul controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless

[Outro: RZA]

You know, cause Wu-Tang is invincible, youknowhatI'mean?
It's Wu-Tang Forever God (invincible)
Knahmsaying? We gonna get down with that W
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
YouknowhatI'msayin? That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation, of the Gods
YouknowhatI'msayin? We breakin egg through these days God
YouknowhatI'msayin? We got the fuckin way
We got the medicine for yo' sickness
Out here, ya knowhatImean?
I was telling Shorty like --
Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year
YouknowhatImean?
(Their poisoned minds can't comprehend this shit)
Word man, it's Wu-Tang Forever God
Niggaz can't fuck with these lyrics God
YouknowhatI'msayin? Knahmean?
(Oh hell no, none of this shit)
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggaz
(Niggaz can't even understand half this shit)
Nah (man, no)
I think niggaz ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggaz ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what? The next Wu-Tang album ain't even
comin out until Two Thousand
YaknowhatImean? That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
(Check for that shit in the millenium)
YouknowhatImean? So, yo, y'all niggaz man
(Be the ressurection) The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here
(Born God)
[RZA:]
I pulled off with Juanita in a two-seater
Just left the lover, shorty loved it, shit was off the meter
High speed down the block, she had the hammer by Peter
Flipped her tongue inside my ear, I was like shit, mama mia!
Bong, I threw on a smooth slow song
As I stuck my two fingers in between her thong
She was like, "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby"
"Two headache, ah popa chulo, de hablo Bobby"

[Chorus x2: Ndira]
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)
Ven baila conmigo en esta Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)
Ven baila conmigo esta Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)

[Fat Joe:]
Yeah
Yo it's the God Joey Crack and Bobby Digi
It looks like these Wu-Tang niggaz beat me to the trizi
They got mami's all over the place
Makin' out with each other and givin' niggaz face
I'm so excited I'm invited to your party
And I'm on the ferry right now with some blunts and Bacardi
Headin' to the Island, not P.R. but Shaolin
Where every nigga got a Wu-Tang medallion
I'm in Stapleton, it's Off the Wall
We puffin' L's in the staircase, the fourth floor
Shorties givin' me brains, she thought she had me
'Til I flipped her over and mad her scream, "Daddy! "

[Chorus x2]

[Method Man:]
Hey, hey, hey...
Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Eh eh eh eh eh...

Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'?
It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True)
I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in
Your popi two-way beefin', let him know that you cheatin'
Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes
There it go [plug], Moby Dick and there she blows
You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose
We can play doctor soon as I drop my jabows

[Chorus x2]
Mommy... Daddy...
It's the Killa Beez....

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

[U-God:]
Yo yo
I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet
About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero
Who's your rhymin heroes? *heavy breathing*
("Killa beeeeeeeeeeees?")

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

[Bobby Digital:]
Bzzzz.. you hear the hornet, you ducks don't want it
I dogs blast turbo, supersonic
Hats off, welcome back, whipe the sweat off
Bobby Digital, half-man and half-cyborg
NY City, home of the fly bitties
With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream ("Pheeewwwwww!") and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

[Inspectah Deck:]
It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kindom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, cuz yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside I don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

[music fades out]
[U-God]
Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit yo

It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I?  Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise

[Chorus: Wu-Tang Clan]
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back

[Raekwon the Chef]
Take it back to the (?), leanin gettin rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggaz, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggaz palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo what the fuck yo?!  Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

[Chorus]

[RZA]
Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw (?) sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin?  You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo!  I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"

[Method Man]
John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

[Inspectah Deck]
New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

[Masta Killa]
This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

[GZA]
From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

[Chorus]

[scratching "soooooooooooo" until fade]
These things just took over me
Just took over my whole body
So I can't even see no more
I'm calling my black woman a bitch
I'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
I'm lost brother, can you help me?
Can you help me brother, please?

You see what we did, we lost the love
I'm talking 'bout the love
The love of your own

But brother, but brother, but brother, check this out
I still don't understand man, I'm all high off this shit man

Well, what I'm trying to say my brother
Why, why do we kill each other
Look at our children, what kind of a future
This is the training thats gonna be given to you
By the Wu, brothers and sisters
(The revolution, the revolution)
It's time to rise, and take our place
Will be televised, televised
So we can inherit the universe
The planet earth belongs to God
This is ninety, ninety, ninety-seven
Every square inch of it
That he chose for himself
Is the best part
Yeah, the revolution should be, televised
By every strong woman
To the highest power
You'll find a strong man
And by every strong man
You'll find a strong woman
Won't you agree?
The universe is not completed
Without the sun, moon, and stars
Won't you be for real?
That's man, woman, and child
To the highest power
To all you fake ass niggas who
Think you gonna survive out here
Without your black woman, you're wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet
I wanna be free
We are original man, the Asiatic black man
The maker, the Arthur, the cream of the planet earth
Wanna be free, yeah
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
Want to be free, oh yeah
The population was seventeen men
With the two man Indians
Making a total of nineteen men for all
Being, for all men, all over the planet earth
Mandela, Mandela, Mandela, Wu revolution king yeah
Arise you gods, 'cause the time for the revolutional war
That's the mental war
Malcolm X, Malcolm X, Malcolm X
That's the battle between God and Devil
Gonna be free
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality
Take him off your brain
Make a change, from my mind
Leave all the cigarettes and guns
The alcohol and everything
That's the mental Devil that exists within your body
Take this pain
That's destroying and decaying your mind
Take these chains, off my mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Want to be free
Don't look towards the sky
'Cause there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet
There's no hell below
Want to be free
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and
Hell is what you're going through
There is only one, god
There is a whole new one, faith
There is a holy one
World, revolution yeah
At one time it was told to me
Yeah
That man came from monkeys, ha ha ha
That we was swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless
I'm dumb deaf and blind
Save the children
You ever heard about the ape man
Gonna be free
And the ape woman
Hey, want to be free
You have a mankind
That has a beginning to him
And its ending is about to come
Oooh, yeah
If you take one step
I will take one with you
Through the stormy vein
Swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know, you got to be strong
Gotta hold on
Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
Save the children
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our future
They're our future
Was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
Save the children
They don't know who the true living god is
And all the orchards in the world
Save the children
So they worship what they know not
And let evil lead them in the wrong direction
Far fewer men than right
Now you got the ten percent
Who are rich slave niggas of the poor
Who teach the poor lies
To make the people believe
That the old mighty true living god
Is a spook in the sky
Save the children
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
Save the children
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous people who do not believe
The teachers of the ten percent
Save the children
Who is all wise and know that the true
And living god, and teach that the true
And living god is supreme being black
Man from within
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslims sons
Peace we out

[Cut to Kung-Fu clip]

I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed
Shaolin Kung-Fu to survive
Must now be taught to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spreads
Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight [x3]
Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight [overlaps INS talking]

[Inspectah Deck:]
Another mission, Street Life, gun talk, Sir I
Don't push me, because I'm close to the edge
Livin on this thin line, I know the ledge
Allegience I pledge strictly to my comittee
Way above the law, we soar the inner city
My crime pays, deep in the metro, nines blaze
Shorties watchin plus adoptin my ways
In the PJ's, the heat blaze and beats raid
Can't see the cage but can't leave the Streets Of Rage

[Street Life:]
It's a Shoot On Sight fair, warfare prepared
Arm yourself beware, hardware tear through your flesh and bones bear
Witness stand clear
Flash the Wu-sign to see if my comrades is in here
PLO began this, ninety-nine bananas
Wu extravaganza, cops scandals and guns, a S.O.S.
Prepare for the slug fest, unusual suspect disconnet your outfit
It's a dead-end Street, I play for keeps release, shots through your fleece
Retreat, delete you from the crime spree

[Chorus:]
Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight [x2] [overlaps entire chorus]

When you got beef wit one time-S.O.S.
When you standin on the front line-S.O.S.
Niggas wanna steal your sunshine-S.O.S.

When it comes time to do or die-S.O.S.
For the five-oh that brutalize-S.O.S.
Before you try suicide-S.O.S.

[Street Life:]
Street chronicle, wise words by the abominal
High honorable, rap quotable phenomenal
Seniority kid, I speak for the minority
Ghetto poverty fuck the housing authority
Not to be idolized, I deal wit grand larceny
Money laundaring, auto theft, and armed robbery
Ninety-nine regimine torment your resident
Street intelligence child, KillaHill pedestrian
Sucker for love-ass, niggas catch a gay-bash
Slim-Fast from the gun blast burner, I last
The S-T-R, double E-T, own a Desert E
Keep it closely, I feed off envy and foul energy
Your best friend's your worst enemy
Thug therapy until they bury me, it's do or die tonight
Shoot out a street light, bleak life
Aim at your windpipe, squeeze tight

[Inspectah Deck:]
In the parking lot, parked in a dark spot
The specialist wit one shot been at the drop
Your Highness INS, darts catch your body
Feds got me on watch wit nuttin yet to charge me
I strike quick, movin on the night shift
Rollin wit those who been the same likeness
Where I come from the blast make your ears go numb
Trust no one cuz murderers range old to young
And death don't discriminate, to choose your fate
Shot wit hypedermic sword wit the trey-eight
Gotta hold your weight, there's no escape from the mayhem
I'm livin for now but tryin to make it to the a.m.
Creepin in the hallways, we always on barrow
Calico crept close to over cash flow
The neighborhood watch, the skunks in my sock got me rocked
But keep my eyes on the shot clock

[Chorus]
[Intro: RZA]
Eh-yo, man, fuckin'..
Mothafuckin' Billy, man
Yeah, man
That mothafucka, man, just called me and shit
From fuckin', a, some county jail, man
Down South or some shit
He's mothafuckin' crazy
I thought that nigga was comin' here next week too and shit
But I guess he went down South with them fuckin' white boys
You know he love headin' with them white boys and shit

[RZA:]
Yo, yo, yo, Billy
He sniffed dope and swallow acid, took cokes of cold classics
Smoked hashes, tote plastic glocks and low jackets
Cross country, cousin Billy with forty monkeys
Twenty honkeys, Harley Davidson bike junkies
In a convoy escapin' from Rosco Pico
And those four redneck cops who had Woppy in a sleephold
The SWAT team, U.S. army shock team
The snipers who shot King, infrared dot beams
Aimed at windshields, gas tanks and wheels
From the bank they yanked the mil, hot lead and stainless steel
Shot through the helments, cracked heads like halibut jaw
Ripped through the wolves and blew the hood off the car
A.T.F., F.B.I., D.E.A., chopper in the sky
Eye witness news on standby
Built to tell, it was Mit from the metly metly
Teeth dipped in P.C.P., hit to the head like a D.D.T.
Hard on the gut like liq' B.L.T.
C-cipher punks with the A.P.B.
Only destroys who was drunk of the J.N.B.
Ran up in A&P, hit the safe at P&C
Documentary on A&E, eight P.M. E.S.T.
Five P.T., the ho tapin' on V.C.R.
Three victims shot, one was saved by C.P.R.
Fuckin' Billy be wildin'
Like Robert L. Lee on Storwall Jackson
He always out for action
I was at an eighteen hole golf course relaxin'
When I received the collect call, BOODOODOODOO
Collect call from cousin Billy

[Phone Skit: RZA ("Billy")]
(Eh-yo, Bobby, I'm in trouble)
Yo, what's goin' on, cousin?
What the fuck, man?
(Listen, yo I need fifty thousand)
Oh sh--, eh-yo, Kinetic
Check it out, nigga said he need fifty fuckin' g's Son
(Listen, yo, we got into a fight
In the bar, shit was just crazy)
Eh-yo, I heard you was fuckin' with the white boy Tommy again
Takin' that acid, nigga
(Yeah, oh yeah, we chillin' though
I just need you to come get me, for real)
No problem, son
Yo, I'll send my nigga Kinetic down to get you and shit (Aight)
Aight, there it is
[Raekwon]
Shake them niggaz
Scary hours no money out, smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield, Lucille, switched cracks on shields
She's a rich fiend, sacrifice her fam, shift them niggaz
to Queens, Guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
Hit the cell phone, regulate with well known tone
A Wally kingpin, who also slam and strike edition
Whattup, Corleone smoke the bone Tone phone me
Whattup he tried to slang there, address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard, transport for him
Rockin Nike at? Rastafarianburg, pipin that
Switchin Benzes, ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Frontin like he's sittin on a lump he's sittin on junk
You wanna pull a heist, draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep, step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned, the century fox, little glocks
Them niggaz with stocks, wail on your blocks
Rich lifestyle, small like an ordinary white child
But right now, Son is still shine, shed light now
Breakdown, liquidate God, fuck it grab the nickel plate
Spencer for Hire, tension when we mention Dryer
He's a slave cop, behave pop
Blue suits who bay stop us blow that cat
at the Purple Haze spot

[Method Man]
I remember stickin fiends at the one-six-ooh
when we was starvin, duckin five-oh, payin em dues
Times is hard in the slums I'm from, they got us barred in
We warrin and cage dodgin, rippin and robbin
Got the NARC sabotagin, slippin cracks in
your camoflougin, now you snitchin on the squadron
That's somethin niggaz can't pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention, and Wu-Wear garment
So I see no need to mention, the potency
of a sting from a killa bee, kickin the battery
out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high you hijack
These friendly skies ain't for you, they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga, ragtime
Keep these niggaz on the run, peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's comin from

Catch us swimmin with these sharks now, you rap villains
(I feel the same way you niggaz feelin)
We feel the same way you feelin, let it be known (let it be known)
[together] What the blood clot you niggaz dealin, you crash dummies
Cash rules, still don't nuttin move but the money

[Ghostface]
Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson, snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his Pumas, nameplate, dude lost weight
Summer eighty-eight, started a fight, that can't wait
Ask Dorothy, same kid pussy up in Marsey
Blazin that Tad Rossi, up in the Marquis
He lost like a hundred ounces, Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch, ass no trousers
This souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
Same kid cryin on the stand with Judge Cuffner
Kissed him with art num it's three to nine style
Before he left he flashin his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver, off the wall pullin his whip
Mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
His safe butt was all fucked up, as he had me laughin
God you see how he was laid out, in the grass
with dirt in his mouth, Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leakin from his teeth he smiled like he gunned out
Big bolo, stackin his shit financed a Volvo
He copped his shit from a small, coffeeshop in SoHo
He still pussy, he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posin like he rappin out...
"So what's up man?
Cooling man"
"Chilling chilling?"
"Yo you know I had to call, you know why right?"
"Why?"
"Because, yo, I never ever call and ask, you to play something right?"
"Yeah"
"You know what I wanna hear right?"
"What you wanna hear?
I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint"
"Wu-Tang again?"
"Ah yeah, again and again!"

[sounds of fighting]

[RZA] Wu-Tang Clan coming at you, protect your neck kid, so set it off the Inspector Deck
[Meth] watch your step kid [8X]

[Inspector Deck]
I smoke on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier
The hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
you battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set
The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

[Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!
So if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more I got
Going to war with the melting pot hot

[Method]
It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth
Moving on your left, ah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they putting shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame, my style'll live forever
Niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "sue"
Nuff respect due to the one-six-oh
I mean oh, you check out the flow
like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dusting
Niggaz off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me [cough]

[U-God]
Oh, what, grab my nut get screwed
Ow, here comes my Shaolin style
Sloop, B. A. Buh-B. Y. U
to my crew with the "sue"

[Interlude]
watch your step kid [8X]
[Ol Dirty Bastard] c'mon baby baby c'mon [4X]
[RZA] Yo, you best protect your neck

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first man you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps
Niggaz be rolling with a stash
ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!

[Ghostface Killah]
For crying out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

[RZA]
You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

[Genius]
The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

[sounds of fighting]

[RZA] You best protect your neck [4X]
[Verse 1: Too Poetic/Grym reaper]
Yo, hah yo, rahh, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo...
Yo, I got stress on my brain that causes chest pains
inside the best frames ghetto blood clots is scored by slug shots
and drug spots, well if you're too poor to move out
or get a new house, it's like livin in a war walkin through shootouts
And you doubt God exists, when hard fists
be poundin on your head like jackhammers
You're trapped in the black drama, you hear the laughter
seconds after that you fade out, you're played out, you're laid out
Your heart nearly gave out, you're lucky that you made out
with just a few scars when the beating ends
The streets [sniff] let ya breathe again
But evil men, will soon be on the receiving end
of Universal Law, I'm callin on the meek and the poor
To fight back and never forfeit the day you have to go to war
With forces that are armed upon the seven continental borders
A mental fortress is essentials to absorb this
My sword hits the human orb until it orbits
In the art of war kids see Grym Reap be morbid
Since pieces of the lost civilization in the past
Had my photographs etched inside of pyramids
To laugh at this revelation, without 365 days of concentration
and twenty-four hour meditation, would be foolishly pagan
I'm ancient as 'amen', see I stay Grym
Throwin fools in in a pit full of pit bulls to be shaken
Or strapped to the crossroads of Hell and inner sin
Which trap the sinners in, to sell such in Sing-Sing
I bring Grym tidings, tidal-ed/titled your wave all not exciting
Stop riding the dick, start writin your own shit
Cause I stick figures that think they fat and can't rap wind blast
I make em Slim Fast, lookin like stick figures
I'm all that, I bag chips at concerts and shows
Get more panties than hoes that boost Victoria Secret clothes
Foes is tagged like ex-foes toes at the coroner's
Kids with cold feet rise and fall like the barometer
Grym will mentally chop your career
See shit is locked down here, like penitentiary blocks in tears
Escape outta your ducts every time you hear my name
you better duck fate, or catch a fuckin face full of duct tape
You get smacked like a trick that sniffed off her money
Then smoked like Rzarector with the blunts dipped in honey

[Verse 2: Prince Rakeem/Rzarector]
Rotate your head like a gyro, my hair grows in knotty spirals
Feet resembles Christ's description from the Bible
Water-walker, immune to all physical torture
Pull out fast in a Porsche, upon a double-crosser
My penis rise up in the morning like a Phoenix
And blast iron cells into a low blooded 'nemic
The imperial - material's venerial
MC's get murdered in serial, you can't fuck with the material
Unorthodox paradox, my shit is seen wide-screen Magnavox
Grabs thought like Doctor Octopus
Cause war like the grandson of Kush
I'm hangin devil's heads on a evergreen bush
Sugar-frosted sorceresses bitches get exhausted
Pussy lips be drippin, like leaky faucets
Undercover C-Cyphers sprayed up like windshield wipers
While I'm guzzlin Piper's, changin my son's shitty-ass diapers
Dime piece trapped in sync like many time piece
You get stampeded by the wildabeast
A rap dast' plus tracks black like Chow Yun Fat
Oppositional forces get their eardrums flat
Common denominator, I swing the mic saber like Vader
He was fooled by the inter-pre-atation made from a traitor
MC's get their wigs blown, trounced off my fistbone
Choked from my death, every time they break a wishbone
Eventually, I knew the whole world would mention me
Potentially, I have the key to make G's
MC's breeze on my tracks, I rock the fruit with the trees
Killa bees spread rapid like diseases
See it's, like the second comin of Jesus, of Nazareth
be fabulous, raise the dead crowd up like Lazarus
Hazardous vocabulary attacks be beautiful
Acoustical notes we provoke, it comes out musically dope
Niggaz realize they just can't cope
The hair, bustin out the head resembles fire and smoke Loc

[Verse 3: Frukwan/Gatekeeper]
I blast watts in circuits like General Monk-Monk was Turkish
My science is divided deep into your central nervous
Pervert area codes peep this murder
I'm boxed-in, suckin hologram tits, inhalin oxygen
Parallel world of crab niggas and sea shells mix
I pierce my dick and sword right through you pelvics
I'm hell stricken bomb, wrapped in trees of palm
Physical existence is descendants of Allah
I travel at high rates, Weaker men are primates
That either migrate or get burnt to the stake
I feed off lyrical light beams of amphetimene
My terminology is panatomic like lobotomy
Crazy el loco, gas niggaz like Sunoco
Flush em like Presto, Blast in your chest bone
I raise from the shore, like Sodom and Gomorrah
with traction, flashin a 4-wheel drive Ford Explorer
While mucus lies within the center of the Rubik's
The roots of the wine induced the enzymes inside your nucleus
Turmoil boilin appointed, niggaz rubbin off my style like a ointment
Lost in the Sahara, From trial and error
Confused with 3 meals for Sister Sara
Rahh! Bearer, Digestin minerals in abundance
Because the dead is not known to return from the dungeons
[Junior Reid]
Run'din from fires of the city, and tee bloood
Blooood, blood, bloooood.. blooood
You two ta both from EE-hee-ma, ah ya both from Jahnker
You ta both from fire outside
You both from To-ah-ee
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood

[Masta Killa]
I was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
rugged with my Timberland boots that paid
I walk with a slight lean from the way that my heat
givin a green the shine infra-red beam
at the stret traffic light recorders
Takin pictures of our corners
Cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
The Chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
We movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
with plastic phasers in rubber hands
Fuck fame, I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
How dare you call the Gods in vein!
Not knowin the seriousness of this and why I came
to Earth, feet first
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
No questionin to the session, I walk with gun
The magnum of bust-es head for many directions unknown
Another statistic, change the bolistics
on the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
Scrape the craters of the brain for data
Old scriptures on withered paper
beginnin take shape and form
when the gods get on it and crash your college dorm

[Junior Reid]
You two ta both from uptown, ah your both from downtown
Your ta both from An-ah-town, ah yah both from 'roundtowm
One bloood, one blooood, one blooooood
The pussy 'nit find it
Travel w'on, raise your wine
That's blooood yuud, blooood

[Masta Killa]
Now verse 2, even more deadly than the first, unrehearsed raw footage
Part 2 for you, I give this dedication, project elimination
He's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
I'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
Here's jewels to live by
Identify before you enter and can't leave with weed
Fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
A bum only has one time to explode
When I break I'm takin everything,
turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone
Rude like Governor Tuse and King Toustume,
who gave the order to bust 'em?
Don't ask this is Genuine Draft
Blueprint ultimate legit sting international, stone love classical
comin back, to attack in black fatigue
Wu-Tang and Junior Reid

[Junior Reid]
You two ta both from Lebanon, ah ya both from Iran
You da both from China, ah ya both from Japan
One blooood, one blooood, one blooood
You two ta both from uptown, ah ya both from down sout'
You da both from An-ah-town, ah ya both from long (??)
One bloood, one blooood, one blooood
The pussy 'nit find it
Travel w'on, raise your wine
That's bloood, yuud, blooood, bloood
Mothers fighting daughters every day
Fathers fighting sons
Sisters hating sisters
Rappers getting murdered, every day
You two da both from Eeh-hee-ma, ah ya both a Juhnker
You da both from fire outside
Ya both a (??)
One bloood, one blooood, one bloooood
You two da from da Brook-a-lyn, ah ya both from Jonx
You da dumb prom queen, ah ya both from Jersey
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood
You two da both from Long Island, ah ya both from Philly
You ta both from Carneitty, ah ya from from over south
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood
[Casual]
It go; gangsta-gangsta, thug, killa
I'm the black panther that shot the drug dealer
I live on the block, where dudes bust they knocks
Ride on top of the car, they crush they rocks
Niggaz hot in my fifths, to run from cops
See I'm a nigga too, so I know how niggaz do
Keep it real, you should let that bullshit silence
You only been involved in domestic violence
Nigga, I chase rentals with Long Islands
Catch us in the club, doing them long, wiling
The microphone marvelous, this Marvin Haggler
It's so obvious, in the lobby, suave and dressed
Where the party is? Round trip, flight to LaGuardia
Nobody dodge, when we walk through the audience
Dolo, with more dough to blow though
For sure though, slide one deep in a four door
I'm poor though, catch me rocking a Lisa Lobo
Bump yo ho, I want more to the boatload

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Your coat can't save your soul, but I'm foe
It's written in gold, hieroglyphic Egyptian scroll
Streets I've been in, from the beginning I'm a legend
Never flee up from my enemies, shots I'm sending
Musical martyr like John Lennon, from the beginning
Spit with a vengeance, semi-automatic weapon repping
Calm stop, warlock like David Geffen
Blowin' ox', like oxygen, out of my nostrils
Seen brave men, fight for they honor and even die
Two gorgeous divas, blowing the heaters down the ride
To the, end of the earth, through hell, water and fire
Queens Messiah, camouflage black attire
Magnum opus, top five, dead or alive
The feds focus my militants, swervin' the lotus
Mossberg in the hostess, I write it then release it
Then I, bless the street, giving birth to soldiers
Rolls gold, King Tut piece, flooded with boulders
I praise Allah, make this a lot, facing the east
This is for them black and white babies, starving to eat, Think Differently

[Rock Marciano]
Poverty stricken, fried chicken, fly rhyme kicking
Blind visions from the mind's wisdom, in this crime religion
Niggaz listen, what I'm spitting is hard as prison
Benches in the trenches, grym intentions, twin Doberman pinchers
Leather trenches, lead drenches for brat endless
Gats eleven inches, ya neck slit it, your head spin it
The epidemic was spread infinite, so once the thread is knitted
For seven digits, it's just business, no disrespect intended
To he who feel offended, a beat down cannot be prevented
Big hit it, the game I'm deep in it, until my Yankee fitted
Switch three, be hanging niggaz, squeeze three eighty triggers
Used to fuck my babysitters, now I whip Mercedes-Benz'
I stand alone, cause I'm grown, for me to crush the Walkman
Gang lover supporter, of any sort, when I'm New York
Rollin' for dolo, the Willie Bobo gotta go bro
Word to JoMo, the kid in the polo, got the world in a yo-yo
Your happy meal skills is still, no frills
Cook ckrills, sign deals, when you see me, just kneel
Or rocking mills, your hospital bill
Blood from your nostril spill, it's not looking well
When I lick off shots, the hostages yell
Chopper fell like ox tail, your optic's swell

[Vordul Mega]
Ninjas with blades, raised from jungles of wolves
In hoods, where hammers bark and the tennis spark
Police on radar, so we stay fogged up
Puffin' blunts, sippin' Goose, and damage
God Damn it's hard, but still, we gettin' by like rhino's
Ones that peel, crucified on the Earth, for guns and needles
Nine inches, hurt, I cause stitches, build
With Gods on track, suffering visible scars, it's hard to relax
Ready to spaz, no weed, thirst for cash, times moving fast
We like cheaters with masks, lighting cheeba and hash
Tryin' to balance the steps, screaming, we need freedom
Tired of bleeding, where ego's let out of evil
Town is of death, no time for weakness
Higher heights to reach, advance the concrete
With iron feet...
[Intro: Prodical]
Yo son I know what time it is
Yo tell em, 12, huh? (Yo hold the fuck up)
Yo Shyheim
Yo tell me it's on (I'm a punch niggas in the face)
Hold that, hold that down son (I got this, I got this)
Word up, we got this (Fuck that nigga, man)
"Shit Is Real", all you rats on both coasts
Brooklyn, Shaolin
The block is hot, straight up (Pussy nigga!)
(Read the rims)

[Prodical:]
'87, drug, never change their game
We regin terror, projects slang to ring up in the Beakle's leather
Plaque for the cheddar, shots out the face of the Beretta
Through the corner store that lady and kid, they caught it raw
Smokin' leaf poor, make me wanna crack that nigga's jaw
Eatin' with the poor, tryin' to live life for what it's for
Twelve years later, caught me on tour Two on Da Road
Two on the track, two with the plaques, two with the gats
Iced out cats, better think twice before you rap
Up in your bitch back, only a snitch get that
Fuck the chit-chat, click-click-clack, through your Adam's app'
Brook-nam grace and charm, remain calm
In these big streets we struggle just to make ends meet
Pigs with heat, livin' out the Devil's deceit
See I'm a rebel plus my level's complete
Bitches say I'm sort of unique
You can catch me as a Playboy sheets
Solid steel meet, I keep it real with the 'nique

[Shyheim:]
Fuck a fair fight, come out my corner with a knife
Y'all big elephant niggas beware of us little mice
You know that we like that cheddar, to make our life better
Every colour, low sweater, drop-top Benz
With the AMG letters, floatin' like feathers
Does it get any better? (Uh-uh, uh-uh) Never, no
Cause I write the rhymes, the rhymes I write be bumpin'
Rhyme architects that be brutal on production
My brick house, you can't blow me down
My thug drug music, smoked out ya town
Radio Shyheim, you can't choke me out
Cause where the fuck I'm from, we moke popo out

[Chorus: 12 O'Clock]
Shit is crazy real in the field
Watch nigga blood get spilled over $5 bills, nigga
And major drug deals on the real
Watch a nigga get mils, and his bitch get him killed

[12 O'Clock:]
Yo, P let's get this dough quick, shit on the wrist
Platinum bracelets, see his Range's the whip
Summer time, comin' quick you got eighty-five percent
Nigga talk that slick and get his brain blown to bits
Throw you in pits and nigga lock like pits
Got my whole fuckin click, nigga, handlin' fifths
They blastin' and shit, I'm after that kid
Who rock that glass Benz, nigga throw it in his wig
Kidnap his kid, throw his brain in the fridge
Slappy and pig, nigga, place where I live
A nigga lookin' jig and I run up in ya crib
Who the fuck murdered BIG? whoever did, do a bid
And let his daughter drop a fridge on his
Move like the wind to Brooklyn Bridge, straight to my crib

[Chorus x3]

[Outro: 12 O'Clock]
Close the mothafuckin' door, what?
Got my nigga R'son on this track
12 O'Clock on this track
Prodigal Sunn on this track
Got my nigga Shyheim the ManChild
Definitely Brooklyn Zu
Rewind that shit, nigga
[Intro:]
Wu-Tang
Holocaust punishment
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1:]
From the hills of the Pacific
I bring fury and anger
Stabbing devils in their chest with a rusty ship anchor
Blood and sand we command and conquer
Wasted land,
Then expand the regions undiscovered by modern man
Body counts increase by thousands by the hour
The sniper on reserve blastin hots from the water tower
Absorbin' energy from the sun MC's run
My brain burst like to blow chunks outta you lungs
Blood on the pavement
Crews gaze in amazement
I was doing that to niggaz who test me on the slave ship
We sell tapes and stage jail breaks for past cell mates
Murder you at hell's gate daring bitches to yell rape
And pale face gests hollow points I swallow joints
With romantic charisma that'll make your momma moist
My voice ensemble of bullets rip through your squadron
Circulate the planets move back you better dodge 'em
Or get opened up like a margin
Buddah sargeant,
Christ I should've warned you I never missed a target
The living weapon war machine by buried king
Relentless remorse is guiltless and unclean
Also the sources supreme of my team
Black Knight brigade peels caps like tangerine
Holocaustic, hypnotic, psychotic, sub-atomic,
psychopathic, hyperactive, unattractive

[Chorus:]
We bring nothing but punishment
Like nice be runnin' shit
have 'em runnin' quick
Uppercuts is what we coming with
Fuck the government
I grab the mic, that's when the thunder hit
Never love a bitch
Rhymes echo throughout the dungeon pits
[REPEAT]

[Verse 2:]
Something from my culture
I stay to harmony
The way of life that best suits me
I sincerely love Allah's mathematics
Freedom and raw The Abbott
I rest within the square
Which is 4 times 90 why niggaz trues dare
The dominant intelligence
99 elements we're offspring celibate
Without knowledge life's irrelevant
I wrote the benevolent (Wu-Tang eminent)

[Verse 3:]
I bring lyrics to existence
When I speak these powerful words
The priest of pandimonium the wargod has emerged
Above sea-level that's when thunder rolls
and lightning strike down
Atrocity lay that poor ass and rain it for you compund
Chaotically the Black Knights we move erotically
Lyrically perform labotamy on your biology a prodigy
A philosophy and theology my idiology's to break down
MC's microscopically
The ghetto tropically gettin' more hectic by the second
Ghetto warfare straight bullets hit off the window sectors
And hit kids cause niggaz spit wigs with no precautions
The war I raise down from their grave to haunt your concious
With bloody screams nightmares and bloody dreams
Of niggaz haunting you through dark alleyways
Through missing smoke screen
Have you tweaking like a crack fiend
On high bean like Christine
The lords rain supreme

[Chrous]

[Verse 4:]
I'm original mallot
With metaphor dominant intelligence
I give a nigga a hardcore detention with his
birthstar invention
I was mentioned I be creeping with the intention
To break free from this evil mad society
Don't lie to me
I'm dope, I scope stuff I like to telescope
To provoke from being choked
Cause my ability is soul lying
And let me open up your insides
And man hide,
Not from confusion with this high energy I'm using
Static got you lighting and moving
Through the abyss where snakes hiss
And many men get pissed for following false elements
For following false elements

[Chorus: last line x2]
Yo, be for real
I was buried on a battlefield

I was buried on a battlefield
Located near Israel
The rest of my platoon
was trapped upon a hill
I heard mega...
...yo, be for real

I was buried on a battlefield
I heard megabombs, firearms, and more alarms
and hand grenades, mad rage in evil ways
My destination was to seek life
I mean the stars were so low they appeared as street lights
I was shown the crucifixion by two Egyptians
There was war in heaven, I saw Christ with a Mac-11
So I joined his army, prepare for armaggedeon... armaggedeon...

They told me this, slowly
Taking me, into, the mental
Orgasms, 'jacualting, stimulating, relating
to life, incubating, rotating around light beams
From a light beam I was formed in the white dream
And then redeemed, like powder, out of, my maker
Into, nature, returned, to vapor
Killah, Priest, was born, in a pillar, of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage
The automatic, for marriage
[Wu-Tang movie dialogue]
The game of chess, is like a swordfight
You must think first, before you move
Toad style is immensely strong, and immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible

[Verse One: U-God]
Raw I'm gonna give it to you, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
you might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force your doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucus Mountains

[Verse Two: Inspectah Deck]
Well I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary, and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
is coming through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
so if you wanna come sweating, stressing, contesting
you'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
A man vexed, is what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
Steamrolling niggas like a eighteen wheeler
with the drunk driver driving, there's no surviving

[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]
Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan, and you're the Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We got chrome tecs, nickel plated macs
Black axe, drug dealing styles in phat stacks
I've only been a good nigga for a minute though
'cause I got to get my props, and win it you
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
lampin in a Lexus eating beef
Straight up and down don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now, who kill niggas fathers

[Chorus: Method Man]
My peoples are you with me, where you at?
In the front, in the back killer-bees on attack
my people are you with me, where you at?
Smoking meth hitting cats on the block with the gats

[Verse Four: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Here I go, deep type flow
Jacque Cousteau could never get this low..
I'm cherry bombing shits... BOOM
Just warming up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin is what's happening
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clapping and
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up, and be somebody!
Grab the microphone go straight to the phone
DUH-DUH-DUH...enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Guff puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tough
rough, kicking rhymes like Jim Kelly
or Alex Haley I'm a Mi-..Beetle Bailey rhymes
coming raw style, hardcore
Niggas be coming to the hip-hop store
Coming to buy grocery from me
Trying to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbott, RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Hoe getting low with his flow
Introducing, the Ghost..face.. Killer!!
No one could get iller

[Chorus]

[Verse Five: Ghostface Killah]
Speaking of the devil psych, no it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and you're I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kicking that fast shit
You reneged tried again, and got blasted
Half mastered ass style mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night yo I was hitting like a spiked bat
and then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm running with thugs that flood mugs
So grab your eight plus one, start flipping and tripping
Niggas is jetting I'm licking off son

(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang!!!!)

[Verse Six: Masta Killa]
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide, when he dies?
In his own iniquity it's the
Master of the Mantis Rapture coming at you
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a Master
Evidence indicates that's it's stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow, changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie paralyzing the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Moving on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
and injure - ANY MOTHERFUCKING CONTENDER

[Chorus]
[Intro:]

Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang
could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

[Chorus: RZA]

Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus

[Verse One: Ghostface Killah]

Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse
My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin terror, quick damage ya whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

[Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef]

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin gold, no doubt
and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin gats but yo, my Clan
Rollin like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo sewwwwwwwww, represent
I wait for one to act up
Now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Inspectah Deck]

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin
Bust this, I'm kickin like Segall, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad, stabbin up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on...

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: The Genius/GZA]

Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin through ya back *swish*
Givin bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin CREAM, I ain't wettin fame
Who sellin gain, I'm givin out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin ruckus...

[Chorus]

So bring it on...[X7]

punk nigga!
"It's true - the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous!"

[Method Man]
Uh-huh, Mr. Biggs, Track Masters (woo!)
It's a Wu-Tang official right here y'know

[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vexed at it, y'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday

[Chorus: Ron Isley]
Back in the game now.. copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now.. shit's bout to change now
Back in the game now.. all my niggaz in the hood now
Better catch up now.. shit's bout to change now

[Method Man]
Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
on that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope

[GZA]
We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle

[Chorus - 0.75X]
[Raekwon] Say what? ("Shaolin shadowboxing!")
[R. Isley] Shit's bout to change..

[Raekwon the Chef]
Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
how to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggaz is armed
And when we get there, all my niggaz in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich

[Ghostface Killah]
Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggaz with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me
We back motherfucker that's right, it's the W.T.C.
World Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tears an' shit

[Chorus]

[Ron Isley ad libs to fade]
[Method Man]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up (one)
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up
(That's what's up)
Eh, eh, eh,
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up

Wu-Tang, nigga, Crash Ya Crew , laugh at you
You bastard, you, pass through, slap an ass or two
Hear me ROAR, Timbaland tree, weed galore
MC's with gusto y'all ain't neva seen befo'
El-Producto, pass that, ya puff too slow
That's what's up, yo, the kid with the buck-toothed flow
Oh, that's Meth Man, south paw, I throw my left hand
To that hardcore shit that even make the Tec jam
Oh my goodness! Trust me, ain't nuttin like some hood shit
Gotta love my dogs but ain't nuttin like a good bitch
Strictly, if I'm goin down, she comin wit me
Whole time screamin, "Oh my God!", ain't no mystery

[Chorus: Method Man]

Y'all Been Warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all Been Warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all Been Warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all Been Warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin our song
Lit blunts, Clan in Da Front, sayin "It's on!"

[RZA]
Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my
Watch the block get clear when I buck my
Boomerang darts, you can't duck my
No tellin  which Clan man you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by, hawk eye
Arrows bein fired from crossbow, I talk fly
You can't Etcha-sketch all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in cess, dope, you eat the cold Tec's
Bold flex, W crown, the ice O-X
Up in the oolie, yo, who you know?
John Bizzi, Ghost Deini, Rollie Finger and them toolies yo
Stainless Bobby, boy, you have an English folly
To try to detain the slang that we can to polly
Plus you didn't peep Arief, kid, you sleep
I seen this heap of shit, you in steep

[Chorus: Method Man]

Y'all Been Warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all Been Warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone

[Inspectah Deck]

Yo,Amist the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin, one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama, fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor, stay locked in the O-R
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum

[Chorus: Method Man]

Y'all Been Warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all Been Warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone

[Raekwon & (Masta Killa)]

Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face fast, mumblin (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin at the cops too)
Eh-yo, my Wallets stay Bulletproofs racin in Coups, yea we the realest
Ultraviolet leathers on, pealin this, love lookin the illest
Gorilla things, monster background with a history
You're pumpin crack, yap clowns, we all real in here
Strap a bomb on a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin of hittin glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsengs, avenge Gods
Picture me stabbin you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine Bin Ladens
Valors on, colorful draws, lookin all relaxed in

[Chorus: Method Man]

Y'all Been Warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all Been Warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all Been Warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all Been Warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin our song

[Raekwon] Yo, you know what I mean? Chillin within

[Raekwon] We gonna swerve on these niggaz one time that's my word
[music fades in]
"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility"
[Raekwon] That's comin from Louis Rich
[Raekwon] Baggin, you know what time it is, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo

[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef]

Put them cracks down you just started slangin two months ago
Whattup with Larry Francisco tell him to let that bitch go
Why you standin there? Posin you like Donna Karan wear
Nigga save that, the same shit you had it last year
You be runnin with them outsiders
That shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders
Your Mac is big, got a little grip, yo
You think that shit gon live what he did -- what this nigga said
Remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
Shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
It got back to me some niggaz in Medina askin me
"You know some niggaz in the gold E-Class," splash to me
Yo that shit you had in Vegas
Yo, it coulda got us both sprayed up, they seen the Ac, know this traitor
Hair sa-laundry and Shorty like Karan
Her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
Octavia with all the ice on, yo
She own a carwash now, her little Keon doin triple life
Marry a Son who got baked, it coulda been
for a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her
Shit is fucked up when they got us yo
She fainted at her baby wake now watch the breakdown
"..face responsiblity"
She fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto street"

[Verse Two: CappaDonna]

Yo all of y'all niggaz got the whole story wrong
Talk what you talk but twist the real song
When it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
Show y'all niggaz whose style is more liver
This is not a act this is more actual fact
Nuttin but experience placed upon track
with the true sound, not lyin out the crown
When we not workin we hardly be around
Yeah see the light, right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
that get on the mic then, throw your cliche
Half the East coast soundin just like Rae
If you a Gambino, give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio, Cappachino the great
Fly cherry head niggaz like planes out of state
I ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop frontin is the issue
It's my turn, live niggaz could pass
Two-face-ted rappers push they shit last
Straight off the edge, into the rubbish
Peep my new style fuck Cristal and Moet
I drink Evian water while my thoughts get published

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up..."

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

[35 seconds of instrumental pass until the martial arts samples]

One is invulnerable, in fact
it involves strenuous breath control
Out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
The human body has a hundred and eight pressure points
Thirty-six of these can be fatal
The remainder, paralyzing
[Ol Dirty Bastard:]
What y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever motherfuckers
this like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'mma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

[Inspectah Deck:]
I bomb atomically Socrates' philosophies
and hypothesis can't define how I be dropping these
mockeries lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun explosion when my pen hits
tremendous ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor die-hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked performing live on your hottest block

[Method Man:]
As the world turns I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence the hard-headed never learn
this my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider a six-pack
and A Streetcar Named Desire who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm what the blood
clot we smoke pot and blow spots
You wanna think twice I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

[Cappadonna:]
I twist darts from the heart tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP Martini on the slang rocks
Certified chatterbox vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my dart I got the fashion
catalogues for all y'all to all praise to the God

[Ol Dirty Bastard:]
The saga continues
Wu-Tang Wu-Tang

[U-God:]
Olympic torch flaming we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory the agony defeat
We crush slow flaming deluxe slow
For Judgment Day cometh conquer it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra graceful music ballerinas
My music Sicily rich California smell
An axe kill adventure paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon rotating ring kings

[RZA:]
Maech or the wooden soldiers C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair in particular
My beats travel like a vortex through your spine
to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat basslines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm ducking five-year probation

[GZA:]
War of the masses the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray niggas get slayed on the song

[Masta Killa:]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
ninety-three million miles away from came one
to represent the Nation this is a gathering
of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

[Ghostface Killah:]
Yo! Yo! Yo fuck that look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend
bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces scum of the slum I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston get fly permission
Hold the fuck up I'll unfasten your wig bad luck
I humiliate separate the English from the Dutch
it's me black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
sazon season these degrees
it's Earth ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence the wave burst split the megahertz

[Raekwon:]
Aiyo that's amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk
Connect dots to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer Blue-Tang all up in the high-riser
New York Yank' visor world tranquilizer
Just a dosage delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean see y'all the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor flex the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland
[U-God]
Countdown...
Are you ready? Are you mad inside?
Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Firewinds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
Soundwaves slay out the back, ?cave? smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cop, hip hop to the limit
Nightwatch, pad mark
Sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
Gimmie what it takes NOW!!

[Chorus x2: U-God]
RAGE ROCK ROLL FIGHT
BRAWL FALL RUMBLLLLLLEEE!!!

[Letha Face]
The diabolic witty, dialect's darker than Gotham City
Wit the possibilty to stop your walkin ability
God forgive me, spark enemies wit pistol grips
The missle tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon ? tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
In God you now entrust
Dog you like hound and mutts, Pound Pups get sound struck
Clown what? You'll get drowned in the cut
While crowd round up

[Chorus x2]

[Inspectah Deck]
Aiyyo yo
I spit bars
Travellin tremendous speed measurin far
Been bustin satellites circlin Mars
Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
Wit turbo tactics, manuever like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
Ayatollah, high roller nine totter
Mind controller, 2009 time folder
My coalition, bring the demolition
Wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
Spittin hazardous darts, up front like Rosa Parks
Makin million men march

[Chorus x2]

[Method Man]
Yo, who got next? Meth got next
I chin check, all these MC's line em up god, I go ? hard
Declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
Police squads tryin to bogard, we rip and rob
The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
Rusty-ass .38 Special, niggas owe me
Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch
36 Chambers, Enter at your own risk
Take that watch off and tuck your necklace
City never sleeps, streets is restless
Rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
Pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
Wu-Tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
I deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

[Chorus x2]
[RZA/Bobby Digital:]
Yo, yo, yo
From the heart of Medina to the head of Fort Greene
Now-Y-C/Now I see Everything
Niggas who sling, Shaolin cats throw inside a bing
Bobby Digital got the golden seal sting
Rhyme star, I write a hundred thousand dollar bar
My pinstripe comma deletes your power bar
Dr. Octopus tentacles, same as different song
Bob Digital instrumental, nothing's indentitcal
You biter, non-writer, Mr. Potato Head or Ida
Deep-fried crinkle cut, one nickel cup fucked your whole LP up
You must be stupid you liar
I'm the purifier, live wire, hip-hop reviver
A suicide mission you're committin, go against the Wu-Tang henchmen
Perfect precision marksman, spit darts an, flip charts 'an
Archery, shots aimed at your heart then
Daffy Duckest will still +Bring Da Motherfuckin Ruckus+
Project Killa Hill be the buckest
Smoke blunts drink Bud Light beer wit Buzz Lightyear
Wet from here to infinity for them white hair
Bobby Digital, overthrow your whole citadel
Mista pitiful, your whole shrap stack is dispicable
Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish
Cherish every moment of his love before you perish
Bitch, chicka chicka chich, watch me switch
Lookin for a bird, I can hitch, into your atmosphere
Take your pussy out like a pap smear
Make you smile, at the same time crack a tear
Smack ya rear, vagina saliva, Trojan wear, rough rider
Up inside ya, dick applehead, opens up your clit wider
Taste the apple cider, you become strong, then become a ?prider?
(Bobby Bobby Bobby, Digi Digi Digi)
Stuck to your ass like a Victoria's Secret wedgie
Heart of Medina to the head of Fort Greene
Now-Y-C/Now I see Everything
Niggas who sling, Shaolin cats thrown inside the bing
Bobby Digital got the killa bee sting
From the heart of Medina to the head of Fort Green
Now-Y-C Everything, niggas who sling
Shaolin cats is thrown inside the bing
Bobby Digital got the killa bee sting

[Method Man:]
Drink a Heineken, as we go inside the mind again
Nevermindin men droppin gem, can he shine again
Most definate, let this be my last willing testament
For the pesimist, exercise for the Exorcist
Johnny Treacherous, like Three, I'm supposed to be
Perpetuous, desimate the poetry cuz everything is close to me
The lectorous, Jonathan, king of the seven seas, battle wit Leviathan
The Methodist, poly to your deficit, hit it up
If I can't live it up somebody gotta give it up
John J., blow em out the water adopt the Bombay
Your bitch look like Strange', look at me the wrong way
Burn one and sautee, bringin you different ways to sword play
They bustin Bullets Over Broadway, Deep Cover
I'm like Larry when the Fish-burn, I burn rubber
Cuz I'm not an easy lover
To the midnight, butt naked wit a knife
Ask my a-alikes, I've been crazy all my life
Hardtime homicide, time flys, do or die
Crooked ass and crooked eye, scripture from the darkside
Johnny 5, I reside, in the killa bee hive,
only the strong gon' survive
From the depths of the killa to the top, we're now born
Wildin on Staten Island be the poet John John
Can't forget Bobby, if I did I'd feel gyp
Like my sandwich ain't a sandwich without Miracle Whip
From the depths of the killa to the top, we're now born
Wildin on Staten Island be the poet John John
Can't forget Digi, if I did I'd feel gyp
Like my sandwich ain't a sandwich without Miracle Whip
[Verse 1:]
I'm fucked up
Most brothers don't have it like me
Like my brothers in the peep, doing half a century
See God I know it's hard
Black stay in ya zone
Big Dust we lost touch see you when you get home
And my man Stan just got back from doing ten
On some bullshit now his ass is back up again
Wait, Ned did 9 straight
Came home knocking cats out
Playing what's that all about
Aiyyo, you gotta maintain killer
I wanna put you on
So you could be a tee big armed guerilla
And to my peoples in the struggle,
When everyday is a hustle so nobody move a muscle
'Cause Kelly got popped from her man
Both found dead, Money still had the pistol in his hand
Power moves all up in my building selling crack
And kids around my way they just don't know how to act
Like my little man stole drugs got some kids fed
And Ted found him dead with a bullet to his head
Baby brother to my man van
But life gotta go on
You still got me in the God born
And what's his name dies from AIDS
Mom dukes outta commission from breaking bothe her legs

[Chorus:]
Yo the inner city life controlled by the outer world G
Another Bronx War Story
Sometimes I have to search for information to find out
Why was we put in these certain situations
The inner city life controlled by the outer world G
Another Bronx War Story
[Repeat last line x4]

[Verse 2:]
Peace see God you held me down like a weapon
The Fam I ran with born the ghetto legend
Big shot is set on and dead on KingPin
You and Big just kept mad bells ringin'
Cross town niggaz still fryin' I hold it down
Lord niggaz ain't wid all the shit we was down for
I'm still struggling bubbling for paper
The herds like back in the day to pull a caper
The takers, now I got a plan to expand
Put it short import export to foreign lands
Stand forever like birds of a feather
Together whatever if niggaz flip that's clever
The weather change but the style still remains the same
Who's to blame with the neighbourhood fame
I knew the game since the days that I played as a shorty

[Chrous:]
Another Bronx War Story
Sometimes I have to search for information to find out
Why we was put in these certain situations
The inner city life controlled by the outer world G
Another Bronx War Story
[repeat last line x4]
[Raekwon]
Call it the Hollow Bone syndrome line
Select sweet nine, face this, watch his whole face lift
Bracelets, murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out, half a million dollars in coats
Flows is genetic, the Corleone connection in all
Selection, stock brokers with coats on
Make coke suggestion, all twin glizzies
Fireman, Gucci boots on, sideways action, murder niggas fear me yo
Cash that he did Clinton, rentin his mother crib out
We send organize the Bill of Rights get lid
Drugs that Hendrix was on, conversatin like the Dutch
Richie Conaway, Goodfellas who honor Rae
Flows that blow thru your roll and Holland
Everybody now, trip up niggas, in clicks we posin rhyme black
Half the year, half my niggas sittin upstairs
Takin pictures of ya niggas wack gear

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah (U-God)]
Listen to the (Clap)
Real niggas (Clap)
Rich niggas (Clap)
My bitches (Clap)
If you love pussy then y'all niggas (Clap)
If you love to get ate, then ya ladies (Clap)
If you real fucked up, then ya'll niggas (Clap)
If you bare witness to Allah y'all (Clap)
Aiyo you see me on the big screen y'all niggas Clap
(Jeans with a gangster lean, y'all Clap)
Good hats, sloppy automatics that Clap

[Ghostface Killah]
Porcelain floors with a dog named Ginger
Bottle cap niggas that rhyme, we the winners
Then slide thru your hood in hoods
Me, Cliff, Patrick, Gary Grice and my man C. Woods
Holdin up gorilla, two niggas got a hold that shit
One shot and ya mans on it
The little kids watch from down the block
Jury box, murder hop, six stash botch, fit hit the ran spots
Spit at the statue with cash and throw dough at it
Fuck bitches raw, why? cuz I'm a pro at it
Big birds danglin, cameras snatch, flash and pop from every angle and
2000 Mark Damon'in

[Hook: Method Man]
Clap ya hands now, Clap, Clap ya hands now, Clap, Clap
Clap, Clap ya hands now, Clap, Clap, Clap ya hands now
People Clap ya hands

[Method Man]
I drink till I'm drunk,
smoke skunk with my stinkin ass, smell the funk
Eekin out the pours, cum stain, shitty drawers
Pissin down ya elevators shaft, no class, writin graf' on ya walls
It be us, fuck ya law, niggas my cause is "because"
No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Ya down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen,
place them chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yakool affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us

[Chorus]

[Outro: kung fu sample]
During this time, I intend to teach you the Shaolin poem
The rules and commandments, that void, deceit
Cruelty and unkindness, always help the weak
Never despise the poor, always respect yourself
[Intro:]

Take that motherfucker
GOOD MORNING VIETNAM!!
Yeah, good morning to all you motherfuckin notty-headed niggaz
Word to the camoflouge large niggaz
Bitch niggaz fuckin my body
Bring that fuckin meth in here
Yo yo yo yo
Now we gonna drink some good Nightrain
and yo, set it off

[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef]

Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit DOWN
As I come and freaks the sound, hardcore
but giving you more and more, like ding!
Nah shorty, get you open like six packs
Killer Bees attack, flippin what, murder one, phat tracks
A'ight? I kick it like a Night Flite!
Word life, I get that ass while I'm fulla spite!
Check the method from Bedrock, cause I rock ya head to bed
Just like rockin what? Twin glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, we going to war right now

So, yo, bombin
We Usually Take All Niggaz Garments
Save ya breath before I bomb it

[Verse Two: Method Man]

I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggaz save the beef on the cow
I'm milkin this ho, this is MY show, tical
The FUCK you wanna do? More than Spike Lee's Do
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO style, buddha monks with the owls
So who's the fucking man? Meth-Tical
On the chessbox

[Verse Three: Inspector Deck]

Yo, yeah, yo
I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost, like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material, made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspector, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic
Representing with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like an ear
The zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
Armed and geared cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system - for murdering the rhythm!
Now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin charge when I explode

[Verse Four: Ghostface Killer]

Slammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fastin, quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox!
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die
My seed'll be ill like me
Approachin me, you out of respect, chops ya neck
I get vexed, like crashing up a phat-ass Lex'
So clear the way, make way, yo! Open the cage
Peace, I'm out, jettin like a runaway slave

[Verse Five: Prince Rakeem/RZA]

Yo
Ya gettin stripped from ya garments, boy, run ya jewels
While the meth got me open like falopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig Zag, Zig-Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel
Suspenseful, plus bein bought through my utensil
The pencil, I break strong winds up against your
Abbot, that run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics

[Verse Six: Ol Dirty Bastard]

Are you, uh, ah, uh
Are you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurah
The Ol' Dirty Bastard VUNDABAH
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that PISS!
Niggaz be gettin on my fuckin nerves
Rhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb
I got funky fresh, like the old specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, and THEN DROP THAT SCIENCE

[Verse Seven: Genius/GZA]

My my my
My Clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer
Style jumped off and Killa, Hill-er
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like getting smashed by a cinder block
Blaow! Now it's all over
Niggaz seeing pink hearts, yellow moons
orange stars and green clovers
[Junior Reid]
Him speaketh in tongues into the hearts of all flesh
Yeah stanyoi
Whoi

[Ghostface Killah]
Oh God, I beg for forgiveness
So help me Lord, yes I beg for forgiveness
Deep in my heart, please, I'm crying for forgiveness
Allah you Akhbar, I fall to my knees for forgiveness
Branded by the steel iron, bullets flying
Ladies being hit through wickedness, I'm losing my grip
I thought we lived by the books, The Bible, Koran
We pick cotton, my back is still hot and dark and
They threw burners in our babies' faces
Pale hands that looked scary touched our bodies in the strangest places
Sweat from the white man's head
Fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head, almighty
Alrighty, niggaz is screwing
God won't you tell me why these ho niggaz is screwing?
I'm sorry father, sacrifice me, leave me wife
Sacrifice me twice, so my kids can see paradise...

[Junior Reid]
So we heed our god king sellasie I, jah rastafari
who is seated in zion and reigneth in all
In the hearts of all flesh
Whoa wow

Fight against them Whoa wow that fight against me

Take hold thy shield and rock and stand up for my health
Oh jah, oh jah, only you can comfort me
La la la, la la la la la, la la la la

[RZA]
Curse to the wicked snakes who try to snatch the truth away
Cursed be the ones who try to take our youth away
Peace to the black, the brown, the red, yellow, and white seed
We don't discriminate man over color/creed
They tried to snatch up our beats, son, and steal our culture
and German Catholics, whitewashing Roman sculptures
How dare you try to deny Allah's intelligence?
Kidnap the truth, and destroying the black evidence

[Junior Reid]
Glory be to the father
Glory be to the son (Glory be to the holy one)
Glory be to the holy one
The holder of creation whoi
As jah was in the beginning is now and forever shall be
Jah world
Jah world without end whoi
So we heed our god king sellassie I, jahova god, jah rastafari
Who is seated in zion and reigneth in the hearts of
In the hearts of all flesh whoi
[Intro: Roxanne]

It's Wu motherfuckers, ah Wu-Tang motherfuckers [3X]
It's Wu, ah goin on

[Verse One: The Genius/GZA]

Reunited, double LP, we're all excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggaz come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin off soft-ass beats them niggaz rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

[Verse Two: Ol Dirty Bastard/Osirus]

Bitch ass niggaz counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead and the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, YaHEAD, get shrunk
The touch of skunk, I be fuckin bitches by the chunk
my name black, do words wanna play in my dirt?
Bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church
I come like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, makin the fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum frisbees on my wall, lookin properly
but come-ly, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers
The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man
my grandfather, step up and get knocked right the fuck out
Come to the cook-out, Dirty bitch at the mouth
You scared? Run around like a plane about to crash

[sound of a plane crashing and explosion]

[Roxanne] Wu-Tang motherfuckers [2X]
Yeah... and RZA

[Verse Three: RZA]

Yo, yo, The Riddler, funny bone tickler, freak Caligula
Bigger dick sex enigma pistol fertilize your stigma
Stinkbox, order from pink dot
MC's get stuck on ink blots as I plug to the sinkbox
Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewalk
Talk strange like B-jork, great hero Jim Thorpe
How can I put it? Life is like video footage
Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
I'm too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souflee sautee for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A, Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessee by the jig
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof, Absolut, mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost, I got yo' neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
sixteen bar nickle sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
and we return like Jesus, when the whole world need us

[Verse Four: Method Man/Iron Lung]

Is it appetite for destruction
Slap a murder rap on this production, I touch somethin trust nuttin
Iron Lung/Twisted Metal
I see em duckin my dart gun, bustin, from every angle
Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
that be code named Agent Orange, killin you slow
It's only right you pay homage
to those that's bout to blow like that shit up your nose, solid
as a rock when I strike target, ver-bal
Be screamin on you like a drill sargeant, her-bals
got me where I wanna be right now, don't know the time
Check the hour on your sundial, watch me shine
Drunk off of cheap wine
Each line be on point when I speak mine
On behalf of my crew, SUUUUUUUUUUU, Enter the Wu
Thirty-Six more deadly Chambers, to take you through

[Outro: Roxanne]

It's Wu motherfuckers, Wu-Tang motherfuckers [6X]

[violins play on for a while]

It's Wu motherfuckers, Wu-Tang motherfuckers [5X]
Yeahhh, Wu-Tannnnnng
Wu-Tannnnnnnng

[Ol Dirty] Oh yeahhhh, ahhh, aiyy yeahh yeahhhahh aiii
[Roxanne] And RZA...
Yo, this is a Wu-Banger two thousand and one noise maker
off the hook guerilla anthem
This is DJ Kay Slay, from around the way
And I'll smack the shit outta any of you DJ's
that front on this shit.. think I'm playin?

[Hook x2 (Method Man)]
I heard you ladies got them Thang Thangs
Do you really?
I heard you niggas like to bang bang
Do you really?

[StreetLife]
I never been a fan of the fame
I got love for the game
Never lust for the dames
I got dust in my veins
Hit 'em off in the brain
Kid talks but its lame
Sniffed a little blow with the rap Eddie Kane
Spent a lot of dough, its so hard to explain
And i fucked a lot of bitches off the strength of the name
Wu Tang see me in the next Lex with the game
Snowboarding down a ski range, its a blue and grey frame
Keep, pointing the finger, I'm that nigga to blame
The main reson why you duck the chain
Self proclaimed, got a lotta profit to gain
And I'm leaving the rap game the same way I came

[Method Man]
Now creep with me, as I roll through the Stat
Little Meth got my back, little pinky fat-fat
Let me hit that (draws), contact, learn how to act
Before you bring that drama the end; I'll fade to black
Positive, I hate kids who tell me lies
Despise guys that wanna get high but never buy
Got 9 lives, 9 wives that dont listen
Bitchin' their biological clocks is tickin'
Wu limited edition hot off the presses
I guess its, curtains for competition
Method, runnin' 'em out, gun in my mouth
The kid your momma warned you about, tear down the house
After midnight eatin' emcees chase through suburbia
You tremblin', behind a crumblin' wall, surrenderin'
Thats what you get, for rushin' in the direction I was bustin'
Polish your sword, your shit is rustin'

[Hook x2]

[Masta Killa]
1,2, testin', testin', mic check wreckin'
Step into the session
Automatic weapon off safety
Dont play me
Butt brings all them things with silencers
My clans liver than your average '85er
Strive to stay alive
I play for keeps in the streets
Cos its real on the battlefield
Shells hit the ground from the steel
Bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
Words combine when I rhyme to feed the blind
Prepare my queen for battle and walk down
I drink from the wine of violence, no tolerance
Game word bond, sword silenced
Me in military fatigues bulletproof underneath
Buy enough ammunition,go round and sweep the streets
Of Brooklyn, Central, sugar-whipped the rental
While I'm lickin out the window at y'all
Fuck y'all

[Hook x2]

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo,
We thrive on street life
We strive to eat right
They blindin' these sight
We tried to be nice
They talk the small talk
We walk the long walk
We lost, they all thought
They forced to fall short
We rock for hard rock
Rocked the hot blocks
Shop and cop rocks
Watch the top notch in action
Begin to make your head spin
Wu Tang my bredren
We bang like veterans
They came for record spins, taste the medicine
Or face the double M, we came to trouble them
Hustle them for their 20 mill then buckle them
Enough to spin out the blue, bitches lovin' them
Dozen men with force of a hundred-ten
Stumblin' thug passions, it must've been

[Hook x4]
[unknown conversation which carries over from the last track]
That's black?
Whattup God?
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga? Word?
(blam, blam blam)
Oh shit!!! Yo!
Hold the fuck up

Aiyyo yo, eight niggaz down (just enough)
Fuckin around with my sound (ci-ty)
Yo, bring backup (ci-ty)
Fuckin with me, and mine
Murderous

[Inspectah Deck]
Check it, yo
The world is shifty, we livin just enough for the city
The rough witty killa bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone
Label them my anus and the casualty's home
It glows coffin, Wu stormin like the light brigade
ride the wave like Frankie Avalon
As I decipher AIDS crime pays
The law's long arm be tryin to strongarm, walkin timebombs
before I bomb firearm
The chalm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster
He toke with his own love and expose the black toaster
Composer was shook
I took your bad looks for joke get your back broke
Deep throat this murder I wrote
The antidote be seekin like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted dead or alive
Rebel I escapes across the desert sand
leavin no footprints to trace
Keep a war face, in your place
Conceal the baby knives on the North breaks
I still shine in shady times

Yeah, yo
We livin just enough (livin just enough)
Just enough (in the ci-ty)
Just enough, for the ci-ty

Yo, in the jungle
I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off D.O.T. be on the hunt for me
We stay hungry, for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my Goddess
The facts tell gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence, a vision
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world
for the world war is ocean bomber
Visionary soldier comma
My code of honor, mind still start from the drama
Trauma sent the victim, witness them run, scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die Son it's bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The future's here catch me on computer software
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official
It's a thirty-eight special, that steps through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but I'm takin forty devils

We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough
For the ci-ty

Killa beez, sting McEEEZ, yeah, Wu
[Cappadonna:]
Uh-huh, ye-yeah, it's like this
If you got big dollars, Spit That G
KnowwhatImean? If you got mad honies, Spit That G
If you gettin dough or whatever
Whips, phats cars, new kicks, Spit That G
This is how we do it
Word up, it's like this, check it out
Check it out, yo

[Chorus: Cappadonna (all)]
If you got ladies (Spit That G)
If you got endo (Spit That G)
If you got currency (Spit That G)
W.T.C. (Spit That G)
Say Spit That G (Spit That G)
Say Spit That G (Spit That G)
More sex and money make the world go round
Dumb Diddy snatch ya chick up, hit the floor now

[Solomon Childs:]
Want money? I need bodyguards, as big as stiff worker, R.C.
Me mega-poverty, New York City, dollar signs prevail
Five place love, exclusive, nine millimeters
My voice box run through tracks like wild cheetahs
Champagne and catfish at the club, Geda's
Janet Jackson figures, I'm on now
Gucci sweaters for all of my niggaz
Calm braided, chrome rims
Ghetto birds with pink Timb's
A box of shells for the Cola for Kim's
Sponsored by the Clan, see
Pop more vanilla cherry than Luke Perry
Now tell me this ain't the thug life

[Hook x2: Suga Bang Bang]
Talkin bout the good life
Livin in da ghetto, wild

[12 O'Clock:]
What happened to the fist fights, the MC battles, nigga?
Slingin newspapers on the Verrazano Narrow
Gettin off the fifth train on Carol to get wet
Summertime sweat got me rockin short sets
From the loaf tops, no socks, Hawaiian suits
Tied nicely with the wooden spoon for the scoop
Young girls playin double Dutch and hoola-hoops
Cap'n Crunch and Fruit Loops, camels and goose boots
It was the FUBU, the stripped Lee's, the Hoopty's
Five dollar bag of weed's a real bag of weed
A ki was at twenty g's, hurled one at dope fiends
O.D., niggaz throwin bricks at my click
Now Giulianni got the state N.Y. locked like cuff
Black Bad Boys gettin rich like Puff
The Excursion truck need two spots on the parkin lot
A stash box for the top, the lock

[Prodical:]
Brook-nam, grace and charm, remain calm with chron's of Lebanon
Black man author, green Leprechaun from Lexington
P. Sunn, I crack ya face with the gun
Smack the taste outta ya dunn, ya fam's on the run
Now y'all respect Sunn, shine all type direction
Hype discretion with the right connection, recitin lessons
But my wea-pon reign automatic projection
Blow out ya reception, hose through ya reflection
Old gold complexion, Sunn I'll swoll to perfection
Did a fifteen, me and my team, supreme legends
Twenty-one-two, I get that money with the Wu
Up in the Cayman Islands, bitches sweeter than honey dew

[Hook x4]

[Interlude: Prodical (Timbo King)]
Eh-yo, let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Eh-yo, we be about it, be about it
Yo, we be about it (Killa Beez)
We all about it, yo we all about it
We all about it, we be about it
Killa Beez, yo we all about it

[Timbo King:]
Yo I slap money for the love of rap money
Rock gully, high cop that bag of bomb
This grown man talk, I could bag ya mom
Watch and learn, block got lots of germ
Straight like that, bake cake, ate like that
Love to kill, I just hate like that
Yo these guns yap bodies on it, ain't nobody want it
Wide body six-hundred, brand new papers on it
Front roast up, corner thugs roast up
Mix the black with green, watch me mack the scene
As a matter of fact, them caps gon' bang
Brook-lawn pack those things, crack/cocaine

[Chorus]

[Hook x2]
[Raekwon]
High potency top, smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, wanna be wise
We, form on a rising corner mean five
Laws in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, smokers is basic
We seen the eyes, laying up playing the cut
What, stay in the truck, something told me duck
Folding me up, my shoulders struck
Out of luck, fuck the potters up
Fell on a daze like a Golotta snuff
Niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding
Niggas in the witness office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing, when they heard the shots
Called the precinct and seen barber nieces beasting
Niggas shot Shalar features and shocked her was a Elisis,
Bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down
Macking it was Dale Breedy the greedy
Caniving ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini will murder charge and benini
I'm feeling wheezy and the drain from the cheeba
Grieving ain't even looking decent
Seeing police niggas reaching

That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my...

[Inspectah Deck]
Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream
Not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping
Don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend
Keep the ruger peeling who's squealing
Few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in
Cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego path and broke down
Reduced to zero
Cops feel we poors hoping I'll reveal my source, source

That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul
Oh oh, oh oh

[Ghostface]
Outside the check cashing, flashing
Dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced fagots tried to cash in
They keep laughing, Ghost you get ya face bashed in
Who gave you these priveledges son? why you maxing?
And we..
Feigning to take those move slow
I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer
Golden brass diamonds embroideries
That was stolen that you haven't reported g
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up bigger
Me and the boys I thought for a second then chose
Rather than froze
Had the jim star on my hand
Yo what the fuck yo! that's when I ripped Timothy
Snatch and dip john like imbaggable
Had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing, boggle-de-dum

That splash against my hollow bones
[Intro: Inspectah Deck]

Yo, one two one two
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
It's the Wu, creepin in the shadows
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang)
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
Sir I, Excalibur
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang) [2X]
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"

[Verse One: Inspectah Deck/Rebel INS]

Yo, aiyyo my rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
and overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, parley like Cochran, it's often
narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks

Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
[repeat both lines 4X]

[Verse Two: Masta Killa]

Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
overwhelmin the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
from this elite fleet
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggaz
feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
and spray, an array of shots
that travel downwind, just respect pyrhiffic pen
as I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
as we stand, expanding our CREAM
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned

"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"

[Verse Three: Cappadonna]

Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranged with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverand, put the best work in

Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
[repeat both 4X]
[RZA]
Yo... this song is...
Aiyyo Dunn this song is called Sunshower
Cause we approachin the final hour
You know I ahh all I can say to my brothers and sisters right now
Is stay close to your families, and all your loved ones
Cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
They killin for pennies, knahmsayin?
Peace to the Gods, we got a heavy job... yo, yo

Trouble follows behind a wicked mind, 20/20 vision
of the prism of light but still blind
because you lack the inner, every sinner
will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
Throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
you cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out
You remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external
Along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
Releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
And permanently upon this journey
Through the journal of the book of life
Those who took a life without justice
will become just ice ice ice
It's been taught that your worst enemy can harm you
as much as your own wicked thoughts
What devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint
Now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
Iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
with rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans
Burn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
I'm convinced, Allah is God always has been always will be
You could travel every square inch of the planet Earth and still be
ninety-three million miles away from the sun
Til you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge
Know the ledge to where your heart is
or fall off into the internal hell that's uncharted
Light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second
through time and space, until it reach a target
And once we're freed of darkness, and show em where the path
Yo as the Red Sea was parted, into these straight
at the narrow gate, but why that's a road to destruction and hate
What you thought life was a sport? A game?
One hundred years short, know the soul is immortal
Walk through many portals, and those who go astray
will pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked bullshit
ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
With dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate
Instead, I chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
of life and fed God Degree of light to my head
It's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so I stay awake
And take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin
so we can see each other, cause every color
that makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?
Who's the original, who's the biochemical
Who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital
Digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
While niggaz minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
the sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em
Stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum
And shatter bone fragments
Cops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet
Thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
Flippin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block nobody's havin it
Those who haven't learnt get returned
You freaky ass niggaz get burned
Some walk around like they ain't concerned
with the hell goin on inside the world
Why do grown men molest little girls?
Is it because the girl's breast has swelled
to the size of a woman, although she's twelve
The whole world is sick, sick, sick
Trapped up in six, six, six
I started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
Tryin to carry on, wishin I had a bomb to blow up Babylon
A vagabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon
goin in circles, like a ferris wheel
Undernourished meals I cherish hope, drown inside the sea of life
Use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night
To far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
you couldn't see a spark of light
While others play ball, I recall, me and GZA, Dirty
hangin in halls, bangin on walls
Kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
Boostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue
Kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws
Started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
to wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
So pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
to funnel the P-Funk, smokin woolie blunts
Dust cocktails and primos, shot more dice than casinos
Back when Wu-Gambinos were called F.O.I. MC's
All and together now crew B.C.C.
REC Posse, G.P., D.M.D.
Ol Dirty stalked East New York GZA maintained Franklin Lane
I was going to Thomas the Jeff, where students got slain
Old Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis
Took share time in Marquis, U-God general contractin service
While Meth Chef and Deck was off the Nu-dol
For white boys who took steroids
Buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
Back when our girlfriends was virgins
Cuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Mary Birchem
A Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving
These young Gods was seekin
Hoes in Westinghouse and Clara Parton and Medina
Girls who sung like Sarafina
On the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her
As if I dreamed her
I was dead broke, now I will use key notes to make G-notes
So it's always hope
See subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
To the heart of Medina, but Shaolin is the brain
So take heed to these words
And feel the power of the Sunshower

Approachin the final hour
Power equality, Allah sees everything
Let's come together under the wings
And take flight, Wu-Tang, the saga, Ryzarecta
In your sector

I'm a dollar and a dream from seein a brick
In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach
I need a beat to expand, the mind guide the hand
Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia
Gundeliro(?) Self I savior, I need the (uh)

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'ma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em

[U-God]
Yo, yo
Line Cadillacs to blocks, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx
Jukebox records, flatfooted cops
Get automatic systematic jumpin in your socks
Mama's apple pie in the park hopscotch
Reunited on the radio, Wu-Tang superb
In the sprinklers girls double-dutchin on the curb
Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday, "Cotton Came to Harlem"
Ringmaster circus was, Bailey and Barnum
Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom
Dr. J before Jordan, Al Green on the organ
When Rerun did the dance, the whole world saw him
The blackout fears, Foxxy Brown, Pam Grier
Ford motor gear, your life and times queer
"Smokey the Bear", Burt Reynolds gray hair
Throw 'em some gems, throw up your fists and say yeah, it's

[Chorus: Wu-Tang Clan + (Flavor Flav)]
Soul power! (Two thousand and two!)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)
Soul power! (For you and your crew!)
Soul power! (Representin Wu!)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)

Without me havin my finger in the plug

"Since you're all so skilled,
let's fight your way - Shaolin style.  Come on!"
[man praying in Hebrew during intro]

[Intro: Remedy]
Feel this,
To all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds for the
countless victims and all their families of
the murdered, tortured and slaved, raped, robbed and persecuted
Never Again, To the men, women, and children.
Who died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.
Reuven Ben Menachum, yo..

[Remedy]
Yo my own blood, dragged through the mud
Perished in my heart still cherished and loved
Stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
Families cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide
Tossed to the side, Access denied
6 million died for what? Yo a man shot dead in his back
Helpless women and children under constant attack
For no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding
Yo it's freezing, And men burn in hell, some for squeezing
No hope for a remedy, nothing to believe
Moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
Forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body
Late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty
Having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions
Deceived by the devils decisions, forced into a slave
Death before dishonour for those men who were brave
Shot and sent to their grave, can't awaken, it's too late
Everything's been taken, I'm shaken, family, history, the making

[Chorus: Remedy w/ Israel's anthem]
Never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Never again shall we sit and take orders
Stripped of our culture, robbed of our name
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our God then burned of our bones
Never again, never again, shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Leave our sons and daughters, stripped of our culture
Robbed of our name
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our God and everything we own

[Remedy]
Some fled through the rumors of wars
But most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
With just one loaf of bread, banished, hold in for questioning
And vanished, Never to be seen again, I can't express the pain
That was felt in the train to Auschwitz, tears poured down like rain
Naked face to face, with the master race, Hatred blood and David
My heart belongs to God and stay sacred
Rabbi's and priests, Disabled individuals
The poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
Mass extermination, total annihilation
Shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
Tortured and starved, innocent experiments
Stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
The last hour, I smelled the flowers
Flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
Powerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest
Crying, who would've guessed -- dying, another life lost
Count the cost, another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust

[Chorus]

[Outro: Remedy]
Never Again, Never Again
The final solution is now retribution
Remedy, Wu-Tang..

[man praying in Hebrew]
[Movie sample]
FIRE!
[GUNSHOT]
[Intro: Raekwon the Chef]

(Can it be that it was all so simple then)
KnowhatI'msayin, take you on this lyrical high real quick
Nineteen ninety three exoticness
KnowhatI'msayin, let's get technical
Where's your bone at, get up on that shit aight
Yo!!

[Verse One:]

Started off on the island, AK Shaolin
Niggaz whylin, gun shots thrown the phone dialin
Back in the days of eight now, makin a tape now
Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
Till I got (BAM! BAM!) thrown one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since sixteen
Shootin' that (that's that shit!) in his blood stream
That's the life of a crimey, real live crimey
If niggas know the half is behind me
Day one, yo, growin all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend, jettin the Palmetto
In Medina, yo no doubt the God got crazy clout
Pushin the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up
Betta watch ya back and duck
Cause these fiends they got it cracked up
Now my man from up north, now he got the law
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin, get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put 'em in a yolk (AAH!)
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit! )
Fuck that

[Chorus]

[Raekwon] Dedicated to the winners and the losers
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Ghost Face Killer] Dedicated to all jeeps and land cruisers
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Raekwon] Dedicated to the Y's, 850-I's
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Ghost Face Killer] Dedicated to niggas who do drive-bys
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Raekwon] Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ax
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Ghost Face Killer] Dedicated to MPV's phat!
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Raekwon] Nigguh, yeah, yeah!

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killer]

Yo!
Kickin the fly cliches
Doin duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin off shots havin to rock knots
Runnin up in spots and makin shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin on my living room wall
My first joint, and it went gold
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spot light
Gettin my dick rubbed all night
I wanna have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now, it just a big dream
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed
Be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers, passin away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin all types of calls from upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure
Settlin for lesser
The god left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
Continue to make hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
(Peace to mankind Ghostface carry a black nine, nigga
Word up
It's on like that)

(Can it be that it was all so simple then)
[Both] Yo, up in the M.G.M. coked up
[Ghost] Sike! Six niggaz walked in flashing they gems peace
[Rae] Aight! One dark skinned nigga fifty-six inch rope
wrapped around twice
[Ghost] Smash the Gilligan boat with ice
[Rae] They threw sign language
[Ghost] Ordered hot coffee
[both] wit a danish
[Ghost] Relax -- whispered, "They rap entertainers"
[Rae] Had Lizzy on, two Japanese birds with furs look good kid
[Ghost] Laid back handlin hors d'ourves
[Rae] It's like round three
[Ghost] We too black for BET
You memorize the 1 to 40
[Rae] I'm at the 19th degree
If a civilized person doesn't perform, his duty
What shall be done?
[Ghost] Pardon me God, that nigga gotta gun
Bulgin out his sweatpants, check out his stance
See the side of his grill?
[Rae] Look like my cousin Lance
Left hand rock a Guess watch
[Ghost] Yo I think I did his Clarks he wore the crush bone leather
with the strings dark
[Rae] Now I remember
[Ghost] He from Bear Mountain
He and Mitch Greene shot the fair one
[Rae] Near the water fountain
[Ghost] Seventh round, Chavez bleedin from his right ear
Yo keep ya eye on that same nigga from right here
[Rae] Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne
Ghost had the fly Gucci mocks wit no socks on
Seen Deion Sanders in the back with the fat fur on
[Ghost] Workin dem hoes with the fly Wu shirts on
Mixed drink session Dunn
[Rae] Pour me some more
[Ghost] Chef leathered down blinking at Chante Moore
[Rae] Tenth round Chavez tearin em down

[Ghost] Rematch scheduled on October Ninth
Rematch scheduled on October Ninth
[RZA]
1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga...

[HOOK: Paulissa Morgan]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it

[Meth]
Ha, holla cross from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since stocks in Clark Wallabees (ZZZH)
African killers bees black watch (black watch)
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts (ZZZH)
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill (BLBLBH!)
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill (BOOM!)
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom (BOOM!)
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse (3, 2, 1...)

[U-God]
I'm the kid with the golden arms

[Meth]
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks (AAAAH!) pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month [COUGH]
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin...
Hey kid, (walk straight as a I...)
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough...
Remember what Old Dirty said, I'll fuck yo' ass up!
Now listen

[Meth over hook]
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
As we go...
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
As we go...

[Ghostface]
E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old

[Raekwon]
Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout

[U-God]
Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the techs and loot this
Executin, shakin all sets, and I'm breakin all hecks
I'm takin all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits...
On the go, check the flow, sayin Wu don't rock shit...
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweatin my pockets
I hear the hot shit

[Meth over hook to end]
[Intro: Timbo King (Prodigal Sunn) {Byata}]
Yeah, get my voice, get the clarity (Sunzini the flame)
{Let me drop a little something hot, what?} Yeah
(Yo turn my vocals up son) {Yeah, turn my voice up}
Brooklyn, Bo King... yeah... {All my Russians come on}
I gotta pull out the guitar on this one.

[Vast Aire]
I'm Vast Aire... I'm like Ali, better yet Joe Louis
I will push my hands through you, I don't need bullets
Show me the signal, let's flow
I be outside with 30 niggaz ready to go
We shine when we rhyme, so I'm, ready to glow
I liked to helm shows, I'm ready to sow
Pass me the needle, you get the cloth
Kunta'll get the thread, and we'll all break bread
This is the true birth of a prince
When I die, this song will be a footprint
I be back with the essence in an instant
I heard about Ason, and burnt an incense
Life's ill, don't get it pretzled
I can't show you, but I'll leave a stencil
I'm talking about what matters, not figures
I'm pointing at the moon, and you looking at my finger

[Byata]
Come correct me, and I really give a fuck
Who won't accept me, you see?
I gotta do this for the underground, broke it down
Coney Isle, BK to Uptown, yeah, they gonna know me now
I'm up in the kitchen cooking up some hot shit
Ask your boy Raekwon, he gonna tell you how I spit
Yeah, Byata live it, it's a hustle every day
I'm on the grind, try'nna see this, milion' kay-vay
But I stay shining, catch me when I'm up in the scene
Rocking the cell plus roots, now your delf, ya silk screens
Yeah, gorilla style, don't make me have to wild out
With the, surrealer, for realer, clap you, and come tell bout
Making moves, paying dues on the evening news
The Russian lifestyle, bitches, we let them lose
Now give me another blast of that green
Til I get open and I'm nasty with the sixteen
They don't even know what's coming
Til them got them rubbing off the rooster
Chick from C.I., to Brighten Beach, yea, we Russian sick
What? Yeah, we Russian sick, uh, yeah, the chick is sick

[Timbo King]
I'm Young Abraham, in front of the projects puffing
If I, honor myself, then my honor is nothing
Even a spirit of evil, in the veins of a junkie
Pay peanuts and you get monkeys
Honkey see, honkey do, yeah, Yacub the foul serpent
Amongst crack dealers, street merchants, Bo King
Yeah, flows from out of my mouth
Up North, Down South, yeah, I'm never without
Extra heat, on some black burner, semi assault
Buccaneer, yeah I'm bucking near holes in your port
Cuz, you ain't bustin' nothing, that's studio edits
Who doing the shooting, your engineer, get all the credit
So while you busting shots in a four hour session
I'll be aiming at cops in the name of oppression
Mack one to the second power, clap off end
I can hit anything up close or far away
Spray lead at the governor's head, cuz he don't wanna
Break bread with the slaves that never been fed

[Prodigal Sunn]
One for my son's money, two for the show
Three, I gets busy, four; I'm out the door, bro
Five, the click get live, the Sunn don't die
Blaze that haze in the East, that purple gush on the Westside
Tech vests with the metal slides, from rebel Bedstuy
I do or die, high and on the ride
This revolution will be televised, through mics, I'm mesmerized
Sight spies, small fries, living lies
Destined to flame, will get you blowned out the fucking frame
I don't bang, but I will let that evil reign
Never catch me tucking the chain, I'm gutter grain
That's word to mutha, main, sustained in this fucking game
Yeah, he shines like aluminum foil, make the mic boil
Ladies and gentleman, introducing, I'm loyal
Blood lines royal, hood raised never spoiled
I'm quick to bury a snake, Jake, breathe the soil
Twist that backwood berry croyal
Taste the green as it broil, and watch it burn like oil
That independent who stays major, rule one, about my paper
It all started on the block with small cash capers
A force of nature, my moms and pops ain't no glass makers
And if I see you on some shit; I'm a fair shaker
I let it out like Sharon Vegas, serving traitors
Y'all niggaz now I shine across the equator
[eerie winds blowing]
[howling wolves]

[Beretta 9]
Aiyyo
Summer ride show down, it's about to go down
Beretta 9 creapin through the fold, nigga, one round
Bloodhound, no sound, check out how I get down
One knee aimin for yo' headpiece, lay down
This is not a playground, did you in, a tre-pound
I'm so loud that y'all niggaz throw a pound
So it's a must that I explain her
Don't want no dog's retainer
Forever will I shine and remain a.. a.. a..
Champ without a warnin, I cherish every moment
I shoot like if I'm on my last
Yo check it out how I blast
My subjects went out and got bought
Take a circle breast shot, took us to the rooftop.. top..
Don't play my next onslaught, this is how a wolf fought
You could get a get-got, Gods watched the hill top
Nigga check the red dot, fakin off yo' Dodge parked
All you heard was yo' heart stop, my nigga

[Islord]
Yo, check the topic to this essay
It's murder in the first, ese?
As I bust a slug through yo' fragile statue
But that's actual, precise timed and on point like a marksman
Four-four, rubber grip, Summer of Sam specialist
Take this four-hunded grain thought that'll pierce ya cranium
From the rear, I don't give a fuck, this is my year
I'm takin this rap shit back from the wack
Fuck who you are kid, fuck where you representin
And after, basically my mentality is on some '93 shit
When you had to Protect Ya Neck in this shit
To be an MC, now it's al about the tight clothes
Crossover flows, platinum jewelery to get a plaque in the industry
But never the I-S-L-O-R-D, I keep my shit muddy
Stay gummy, ya fake ass gangstas

[Chorus: Prodical]
Aiyyo
We still comin, stay gunnin, stay sunnin
Shine top of the 4th hit, we run shit
Classic black matches, Killarm', ice charm
In the black Yukon, you fuckin bastard
Still comin, stay gunnin, stay sunnin
Shine top of the 4th hit, we run shit
Classic black matches, Killarm', ice charm
In the black Yukon, you fuckin bastard

[P.R. Terrorist]
Call me the rebel, bust thirty-three shots at the Devil
Tell 'im I love 'im just because I made 'im
Plus there ain't no way to escape him
On the fire escape with the narocotic from the one-two-oh
Station, I'm impatient, my firearm driftin with starvation
Divine mind, I Power Rule, United Nation
My DJ's spinnin the latest from the out the crates and
Killarm's rockin the stage like a brigade and
My own congress, government rocket launchers shit
Strikin on ya Five Consciouses
NARCes men didn't know I put the toxic in
Til they got burnt by the scorpion (Uh-huh)
I spit lyrics that's like bad for ya health
I'd blow gun powder right off of he shelf
My brain power cause a rain shower
Restrain cowards, pull out to the heat and flame at ours

[9th Prince]
Aiyyo
A Soviet deep in Paris, Playboy rabbits want carrots
Luxury marriage, life, ain't havin it
I keep the forty-five automatic like Mathematics
Start terminatin savages, I'm raw like 'caine to easy addicts
Street tactics, layin down the caskets
On biblical war, perform Michael Jackson Thriller but way iller
A slave killer, protected by Shaolin and Brooklyn Zu guerillas
Under my pillow, I sleep with grenades, untraceable heaters
Stay deeper than scientific readers
My cipher sounds will ding pound, I blast you on ya nightgown
Kidnap ya child, might give him to the crowd
On my way Uptown in my '95 Millenium
Seen Killa Sin and 'em, that nigga sound feminine
Remember 9th Prince, I'll forever get up in 'em

[Killa Sin]
Killa loco, vocals hold you hostage
Gothic, size out live shit, catch a wise quick, focus
We stone fist explosive, load 'em like fo'-fifths
To roast clicks, ferocious as ro-bitch, with no cinch
My thoughts so dense they form mist
I swarm quicker than norm, my Bee stingers stay dipped in corn liquor
Warn niggaz from the last time, my past time hobby be
Robbin niggaz in they lobby, G, come out ya Wallabees
Fifty-six penny-weight chain limit the policy
Modernize crime comodity, now let us get what?

[Chorus x2]

[Unknown Singer]
We got fire.. hot.. burnin hot
We got fire... from The Sun
Still gon' win from the streets cuz there's no smoke with no heat
Still gon' win from the streets cuz we ain't go no heat
We got fire... from The Sun
[Doc Doom:]
Oh how I love my a hundred spokes
Flossin and shit, California
Flossin on them gold ones
Black Knights
Old ones, I sold them
Sippin on a cold one, Rollin on them gold ones
The chrome was the old ones, I sold them

Can I get a drum roll please for my gold D's?
Hundred spoke Daytonas, wish we all could be California
Smokin bank in the corners in a black six-deuce
Hittin switches, dippin, switchin on that ackrite juice
Act like you, wan' try and take my D's
Watch how fast these slugs in this thang gon' leave
Watch how many holes in ya body it leaves
Watch how much pints of blood you bleed
May the fake thugs retreat, pop up barkin the heat
Caravanin nine-to-ten cars deep
Down the 'shaw where Knights is known to breakin laws
And if a bitch is ridin with me she's takin it off
Now get off ya job, if not bitch I'm layin you off
Cuz I guess the last nigga that you fucked with was soft
That ain't me, it cost just to floss with me
And how I love my a hundred spoke D's

[Chorus x3.5: Doc Doom]
Rollin, sippin on a cold one, Rollin on them gold ones
The chrome was the old ones, I sold them

[RZA:]
Yo
Up in a black bourbon tank labelled GMC
Smokin on a Newport long and PCP
Gat tucked in, easy pass, I'm low duckin
Dimepiece bird on the side I'm finger-fuckin
Bouncin off this deuce-deuces, fat like Polo gooses
Eighteen-inch woofers movin studio acoustics
Rim tri-star, chrome on my side-bar
Don't hate crab cuz I caught ya bitch eye par
Platinum grill, re-enforced solid steel
Superstar engine, force of an eighteen wheel
That'll crash through brick walls, smash intersections
Move through ya city escorted with police protection
Heated polished seats with back massages
You gotta know how to roll in more like Kenny Rogers
Tinted glass, PS2 plus Dreamcast
Smoke screens, blindin high blasts
GPS satellite navigation
Automatic lock doors drop jackers to the station
You got beef you get fed to Doc Doom
Goon, you can't fuck with Wu Killa Bee Clan platoon
I might get Holocaust to come and cough on you
My nigga Crisis might love to let one off on you
Or Rugged Monk rolls up another blunt
The great Digi goes and lures out another cunt
Cuz I be Rollin, Rollin, Rollin on them twenty-twos
Ain't got no money or love for you funny fools
Cuz I be Rollin, Rollin, Rollin on them twenty-twos
Sippin brews, packin tools for you funny fools

[Monk:]
I'm from the land of chaos where niggaz get shot for trippin
I caught a fool slippin on some D's, now I'm steady dippin
Cruisin, movin up the block cuz I'm the shit
Stick dick to hoodrats, make gangsta hits
I baptize my sticks, ice skate on seventeens
On the phone with five-oh, don't you love them D's?
While they spin, you freeze in ya souped up paint clean
Fifties, amps, six by nines and thangs
Comin down the block, let my sub straight bang
Like, "Fuck the po-po's, I'm not turnin it down"
I love to floss as I toss up a fifth of that Crown
Bank corner after corners, watch all the ho's smile

[Chorus x3.5]
[Intro Part One: Method Man (album version)]
Yeah, torture motherfucker what?
(Torture nigga what?)
What?
I'll fucking
I'll fucking tie you to a fucking bedpost
with your ass cheeks spread out and shit
Right?
Put a hanger on a fucking stove and let that shit sit there
for like a half hour
Take it off and stick it in your ass slow like
Tssssssss

Yeah, I'll fucking
Yeah I'll fucking lay your nuts on a fucking dresser
Just your nuts laying on a fucking dresser
And bang them shits with a spiked fucking bat
Oh

I'll fucking pull your fucking tongue out your fucking mouth
and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver, BLOW!
I'll fucking

I'll fucking hang you by your fucking dick

sew your asshole closed, and keep feedin you

[Intro Part Two: Genius (all versions)]
Yo, roll the dice, yo roll the dice
Yo, so it's going down like that, huh? Yeah?
Niggaz is whylin, check it out kid

From the slums of Shaolin, Wu-Tang Clan strikes again
The RZA, the GZA, Ol Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon the Chef
U-God, Ghost Face Killer and the Method Man

M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN [x4]

[Verse One:]
Hey, you, get off my cloud
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Who be gettin flam when they come to a jam?
Here I am here I am, the Method Man
Patty cake patty cake hey the method man
Don't eat Skippy, Jif or Peter Pan
Peanut butter, Cause I'm not butter
In fact I snap back like a rubber
band, I be Sam Sam I am
And I don't eat green eggs and ham
Style will hit ya, wham!, then goddamn
You be like oh shit that's the jam
Turn it up now hear me get buckwu-wu-wild
I'm about to blow light me up
Upside downside inside and outside
Hittin you from every angle there's no doubt
I am, the one and only Method Man
The master of the plan wrappin shit like Saran
Wrap, with some of this and some of that
Hold up (what?) I tawt I tat I putty tat
Over there, but I think he best to beware
Of the diggy dog shit right here
Yippy yippy yay yippy yah yippy yo
Like Deck said this ain't your average flow
Coming like rah ooh ah achie kah
Tell me how ya like it so far baby paw
The poetry's in motion coast to coast and
Rub it on your skin like lotion
What's the commotion, oh my lord
Another cord chopped by the Wu-Tang sword
Hey hey hey like Fat Albert
It's the Method Man ain't no if ands about it
It's the Method

[Break:]
All right, y'all get ya weed out, get ya meth, get your skins
Don't forget your forty
And we gonna do it like this

I got, fat bags of skunk
I got, White Owl dub
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted

I got, myself a forty
I got, myself a shorty
And I'm about to go and stick it
Yes I'm about to go and stick it

[Verse Two:]
Uhh
H-U-F-F huff and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowing
Zoom, I hit the mic like boom
Wrote a song about it like to hear it here it goes
Question what exactly is a panty raider
Ill behaviour, savior or major flavor
All of the above oh yeah plus I do so
Also flam I'm the man call me super
Not an average Joe with an average flow
Doing average things with average hoes
Yo I'm super I'll make a bitch squirm
For my, Su-per Sperm (check it)
Check it I give it to ya raw butt naked
I smell sess pass the Method
Let's get lifted as I kick ballistics
Missles and shoot game like a pistol
Clip is loaded when I click bang dang
A Wu-Tang slug hits your brain
J-U-M-P jump and I thump
Make girls rumps like pump and Humpty Hump
Wow, the Shaolin style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is calling me
P-A-N-T-Y-R-A-I-D-E-R mad raw I don't cry
Meaning no one can burn or toss and turn me
Ooh I be the super sperm
Chim chimmeny chim chim cherie
Freak a flow and flow fancy free
Now how many licks does it take
For me to hit the Tootsie Roll center of a break
Peep and don't sleep the crews mad deep Wu-Tang
Fading motherfuckers like bleach
So to each and every crew
You're clear like glass I can see right through
You're whole damn posse be catchin em all cause you vic'd
and ya didn't have friends to begin with
I'm

M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN
M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN
M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN
M-E-T, H-O-D, MAN

Here I am, here I am, the Method Man

[Outro: RZA]
Straight from the slums of Shaolin
Wu-Tang Killa B'z on a swarm
(Your soul have just been taken through the 36 chambers of death, kid)

[coughing]

(Word to mother, Method Man signing off, peace)
[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques
Do Rae Wu, Do Rae Wu
Digi lematina, Digi lematina
Ding dong ding, ding dong ding

[RZA:]
Yo
The wick is lit, the bombs start to tick, tick, tick
Countdown, BZA Bobby 'bout to spit
Explode every MC in a four mile radius
Still mad with stout like I'm Doctor Octavius
Place to brace, I could push on a rival plate
The pulse of a Digi stare, make a spiral break
Mouth the rhyme, blow his man outside the orbit
Who ever thought this thug hip-hop wasn't goin' corporate
And gain weight like Chinese put on eight dragon
And 'W' on the Flag and and everybody's braggin'
Neightborhood wiggin' out cuz the God's livin' out
Without biggin' out, Wu-Tang Clan biggin' out
Hollywood political wished off, It is Yourz
Ready for the next LP to hit stores
I got more serious, my smoke be furious
My night time walk should be named to Nigerious
It crucified you upside down on a wooden cross
Shouldn't have doubted the trojan, threw you in a wooden horse
Ol' Dirty break these niggaz off
You be bitches dumb soft

[Chorus: w/ RZA]

[Interlude: RZA]
BOODOODOODOO!!! Yo, yo, yo

[Ol' Dirty Bastard:]
Who want me to show the reels? I do magic spells
Children love shootin' guns on devils kill
I want a girl that's only too meak to squeal
And Wu-Tang keep that shit concealed
Roll with me in the drug mobile
Fuck my bitches, take it on the wheel
Played it all over the world until
Wu-Tang secret now revealed
O's is killin' all people for head over heals
I'm not a 'ciple with +Little Rascals+
Villians, all attracted to my shit for man silk repellent
I'm not the well-in, white boys can't get with melon
I'm sayin' Wu-Tang is supreme to my wife and ho bitches on tour
To make sure, insure, that my wife got paid while I was ditch poor

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ding dong ding, ding dong ding
Ol' Dirty Bastard squashin' shit
Comin' at ya.
[Chorus: Hell Razah]
You got my back, I got your front
From the start to finish
Goin out altogether cause we're co-defendants
Take my back, got your front
From the start to finish
Goin out altogether cause we're co-defendants
Got your back, take my front
From the start to finish
Goin out altogether cause we're co-defendants
Got my back, got your front
From the start to finish
Goin out altogether cause we're co-defendants

[Shyheim:]
I'm a N.W.A. with nineteen shot glizzy
I'm all thugged and Krazyie, Layzie, Flesh, Wish and Bizzy
I'm too wild, you don't wanna see my act up
Police gotta call the national guard for back up
My shit don't stink, I never touch my link
Shyheim never sleepin, my eyes just cheat me
And my army moves same, same

[Hell Razah:]
Stick him for his mink
Yall niggaz on some frontin shit, amped off a drink
Money like to bring truck, bomb you till you faint
I roll with top rank, soon to judge the angels sing

[Shyheim:]
I'm ghetto like ?sun-do?, Wu-Tang Clansman
We banned from the tunnel,

[Hell Razah:]
We're scorin touchdowns, well yall wack rappers fumble

[Shyheim:]
And talk about the projects, we never see you come through
Catch em at their shows, their hidin in a limo

[Hell Razah:]
We claimin Donnie Brasco, black Robert Deniros
We're dirty street heros in the six double zeros

[Shyheim:]
Benz, glocks with the infer-red lenses
Money over bitches, like P, I'm infamous

[Hell Razah:]
Thoughts is infinte, me and Shy run together
Like the current census

[Shyheim:]
We're co-defendants, society's menace
I became a Jon Doe, so I be printed

[Chorus: Shyheim]

[Hell Razah:]
Aiyyo, it's war faces, I see outside the court cases
See the first chapter become the bone body fracture
I roll with player haters, down to mat rafters
Out to put the gat to anybody playin after
Climbin up ?Jacken's? latter, the common factor
Red hook, never shake hooks or get you shit took
Black hook indian givers with a sick hook

[Shyheim:]
Hit with the book, I was hit with the book
I'm a walkin timebomb, I smoke weed to keep me calm
It's like she said, "I'm a bad mother fucker"
When she read my palms, I did armed fuckin felony
And with my moms tellin me, a twenty-seven D.V.D.
For reals and mad man, in a instant a raider
Is where we stash the grills
It's all about the hundred dollar bills, Nigga what
If shorty pushes you big, I stick it in her butt

[Chorus x2: both]

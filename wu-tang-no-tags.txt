and i'm prepared to take the shit i dish out


on the, yo, on the expressway, suddenly, i un-hit the breaks
a mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
i pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
the vibe got colder when the marksman said
"yo, you in the truck, get the fuck out your car
put your hands where my eyes could see, not far"
a fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
plus my half pound just rang the bell
of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
i guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
some mc's wanted for a string of break-ins
last seen wearing lonk minks and snakeskins
okay god it's like this
if we don't manifest our power to the fullest
man, you know what i'm saying?
nothing will become of everything that we plan

understand and understood god
see we goin' show them the strength in what we doing
cause this is for he babies (indeed)
that's why it's on the strength
everything is on the strength

simultaneous anger to this life i'm no stranger
galaxy mission to attack in the track black
diplomats in the world called rapture
death was a concept i didn't want to capture
the laughter singing over? mantress d?
street colleagues slow up,
their man got tow up
guts be throw up sipping on rum
we sing from the creed of a begger's last son
cash fast fun, no life undone
take what you need son cause you daddy made mo' than one
and it was fun 'till reality formed screaming
from a palace where the weather's warm
yo you have to be the father and the lord of the score
used to hover here now it's cutting your vocal cord
no mo' speaking the lies to the weak
'cause i'm about killing these guys with my feet
today it's a stage maybe later it's a cosmic course
the general i be rocking on the horse
on the strength of course don't let it be in vain
cause it's time for the beggaz to reign, remain

a vision my facility a death world trilogy (you see that shit)
now fictional plots speak out through gunshots
battles won and lost at the of heaven's throne
the sky rains blood drowning the earth with red mud
i be sitting on the edge of mars counting stars
finding me a place in space unchaseable
no mortal can't fulfill such skill they incapable
of keeping all the planets in-line with one mind
make the sun and moon both shine at one time
i orchestrate the guns that air for god's sake
precipitate make rain, hail, snow and earthquake
levitate the gravitational pull of haleys comet
shake the chords of earth make a euro-volacanic vomit
ebonic with sonic waves that blaze the human flesh
it flames extra-terrestrial it's time to reap professional
feel the untestable force burning your course
hints of visible thoughts be the source of begga sorcery
... begga sorcery

on the strength
time is money and gain
on the strength
math is one and the same
on the strength
whining is something for pain
on the strength
beggaz for ever remain

buddah hava who lives the ways by nature
escape on a galactic space caper
to the nexus, transportation a glass lexus
forever present is wu chi in the essence
of life is immortal
we travel through portals that's phenomenon,
paragon through the octagon
my chi gong is calm, express through alvatron
love hell alright is the day destroys the night
knife divides today feathers are harmonious
and universal ways to escapades
we take what we need to survive and stay alive
draw more sometimes as we break through the other side

the knoliton master law and order
astrolgoic civilize the human family throughout the populous
live forever like metabolics
everything i speak has logic
estimated all partsman of the chief king fistboxin'
inscribe within the begga doctrine
manual infold i roll protect my physic
from elements of the globe
we communicate like space probe,
remainder of the square frag the author
of the final chapter seven star grandmaster
pugilist john trappa m.d.
go-go thirteen professional mc
i bomb squads like hank sharpley
expose a fraud like hardcopy
i know click and shoot like paparazzi
with the never conclusive euro language of usage
street persona, my thought is blacker than the pre-madonna
far and beyond, if lickin' who warfare like sadam
invade everyone like ghangis khan
forever will remain
and the beggaz will continue go on...

handle your bid and kill no kids

millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
that's that fire move like schwinns yo
invisible pens that write light, leave blends
hit with the jf kennedy shot
smash with the acapulco rifle got got
bolt off, but got clocked
legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
design your alphabet, reps get graded
we in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
home of allah's ten big rooms
so what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
exotic gods bust my hammer at frauds
call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
gucci jumper x-5, gettin more head


i scream at the mirror, curse, askin god, "why me?"
run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
i'm god-son, son of man, son of marcus garvey
rastafari irie, ha-ile selassie
police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
it takes more than metal bars, we destined for ours
i hear murder plans from dopefiends, with elephant hands
snots in they nostril, the blocks is hostile
there's no pots to piss in, glocks is spittin
rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
it drove lots of men to die with no name
i been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
i'm the animal that hugh heffner created
the only nigga sade dated, the most hated, nas nigga


roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
c.o. flip and jerk the whole yard rec
block vets, pop barettas glocks and tecs
you're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
checkin shorty with the +black tail+ stance, leapord pants
yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
semi-autos roar in the building hall
symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
call it a new york state of mind, gotta take mine
in the daytime, the jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
so i live by the sword and obey hood laws
make my team click like high heels on wood floors

yeah
yo

expedite lyrics under a godly spirit
thoughts forced to hang-glide
even a bird can hear it
a bald head with gold metal wings
look like it belong in a day
the coming of christ
worshippin' the elohim
that's the way i wear shades like ceelo green
it's darker than don cheadle
we're mean like his deleted scene
the prognosis, divine opus
artistic third eye open, it leave you stuck in a psychosis
or the haemo-tosis
spit venom like a african cobra in the jungle
knowin' my tongue is vulgar
i raise the wu flag when they scream for glory
the clouds open, a beam of light, you hear my story
custom-made scrolls, handwritten in coffee
and feather-tip pens one of the prophets brought me
and that explains why i spin on the axis
born original, so my mind fades to blackness

seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

pledge music, we came up from bringin' out club music
acoustic jungle rap gave us all this project music
blood in it, plug niggas get you mugged in it
steel with steel, i'm finally out the drug business
kneel proper for me, helicopter base, sage in it
lessons from professors on stage winnin'
nine swords, 36 chambers
it's like a chess board, keep slidin'
opponents get flamed on it
trainin' poems, been the game of thrones
we been raised and grown
these young boys come through, spray your home
facts, they gave me the ax, now lay it on me
criminals have to eat, it's facts, shorty
you're damn right i go the square miles
we're from the stairs, thousands of pens could hear us from the rare sounds
yeah, the phoenix comin', ten arabian staten-adians
who hooded up, known to get it bouncin'

seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
i can't live without my faith, so i don't walk without it
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

seen a lot of things
i can't live without my faith
god, i know you led us to do better on this road
on this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"give it up! but - it's - just - no - use!"

"give it up! oh lord.... give it all to you
i try, but - it's - just -  no - use!"

aiyo, give it up, rush you up, no fuss, blood rush
cuss much, what's mine? you bust nuts, crunch crunch
spark the bud, what's what, the white king tut
out in so-fuck, look who they dug up, yup, it's the rugged
on the record with j-live, i could hardly believe this
i never thought i'd be rapping on no record with school teachers
hair flinch from the eighties, library, lies bury
tv, tell lies visually, kid you wit me, hostility
humility, hillbilly, gorilla, he mentally illy
still is he, actually, really killed me, billy
all that stuff you heard about me, is probably true
heard i got the aids virus, i probably do
ammunition spitting is him, is it, you listening
littering written, it's in slippers, get the rebel in him
sticking it with sinners, sizzlin' rhythm, verbally hit him
did he did it, or did he didn't, admit it
pretend he ain't offended, the men and women
every minute they in it, don't be
every illiterate ignorant critical dissed it
every idiot that ain't live it, they talking shit
i'm r.a. the rugged man, get off, my dick


give it up, for the gods & the earths, ladies and gentleman
all the human families, the wicked can't stand me
the righteous man hands me the mic, it's uncanny how
one man's penalty's, is another man's boo-whore
the label pun's ironic, courtesy of this sport
still can't stop a grown man, from pressing report
a free man can either be freedom or free label
when you spent, what you make, to keep making, you can't save
a damn thing, no savings, that's how life'll enslave ya
that's why i strive daily; to be my own savior
i know when shine glows and reflects in my behavior
so caught in between checks, i spilled it in respect
so give it up, if your mission's belittling my position
as a microphone physician, making you listen
me and rugged man relate, through a previous poem
like he said, i'm mad famous, for being unknown
on records for ten years, i can hardly believe it
never thought i'd be perceived, as just some rapping school teacher
just some dude, that can cut and rhyme, same time
just some conscious kid, that's try'nna save the world through rhyme
just another underground, hand-to-mouth microphonist
stop your mirror rap, just to stop you in your tracks
this will stomp you on your track, justice is not just
another ordinary rapper, i'm the crown royal block
with a velvet bag, matter of fact, and since the swagger is back
and backed by, a whole nation of millions
you can't hold me, my new floor is my old ceiling
that's why i'm guaranteed, to leave you with something you lack, so just

(make me yours) he get out of line, break his fucking arm...
you know how it go (what am i supposed to say? yeeaaah)
you know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggaz, man
(somebody tell me what do i do...)
none at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man

aiyo, jump out the acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
us locking the game, word to every hand on the lockmen
street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
this is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
study like lessons, niggaz in the game biting the grain
you knowing where it came from, stop it
you thought we wasn't coming? you dumbing, you blunted again
watch lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
can't nothing move when i rhyme, when i drop lines it's law out in egypt
love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
the only niggaz that'll glow'll be us
yo, throw me in sin city, leave me with the vultures and bats
then give me two weeks to bubble like kim titties
dirt dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
cuz if things change, you know it ain't against wu

what am i supposed to say? yeeaaah
somebody tell me what do i do...

we keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
we never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
raining with the patchwork of puzzles
that was written in the year of the dragon
more raw than you could ever imagine
how much of a great blessing to a rap city
where the youth is organically fed, from the witty
unpredictable, talent and natural game is lyrical
analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
a cuban link chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
ragu nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
he gave y'all niggaz whiplash from bling bling
but my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
for the lower level creatures that can't peep it
i observe mc's, regardless
from a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...


let the track wind and ya mind flow free
remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
infinity, back to the source of which it came
energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
on and on and on and, travel with me
not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
for those who can't adapt, i lived it, shitted it back
we have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when i'll squeeze
the brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
underneath the white t lies the four pound
this is forty-five minutes of menacing
dismantling, any mc opponent stepping in the zone
get ya face blown (get ya face blown)


observe the word, when i speak, get the truth's heard
true to the curb, wu classic is the new birth
spreading the blessing across seven continents
arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
check the techniques, first bow to the abbott
witty unpredictable, gritty individual
valid, if it's actual, talent and it's natural
game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
i and i ride or die under the name
w-u, the primary, ya secondary
definitely not necessary, the legendary
you printed the blueprints to do this shit
moving the youth in the bricks
spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
through the chest, when i manifest my sick art

speaking my mind, fall in line when i spit mine
still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
if this is a crime, find me guilty, i'm so sublime
so rapid with rhymes, same slacking is assonine
revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the wu
gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
in living proof, i'm the wittiest unpredictable
most talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to

i'm a hustler, i grind til my pack is done
give a seed, mad knowledge til they cracked and run
can't nobody fuck with me, i'm just too nice
smack niggas in they head everytime i write
yo, i'm straight from park hill where the guns is popping
where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
go to school fucked up, it's africa island
we poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent
a mi name swnkah, comin' live
big up rza, mathematics, all wu-tang clan
a we come for chinatown to babylon

if i put my fist through the face of a racist
smack 'em tasteless
would i face three cases in court, locked in places
or shackled to a seat of a bus, a hundred of us
life in america shouldn't be so tough
we got western civilization got me fighting for my civil rights
after fighting scores of war, we still fight for our civil rights
to be equal citizens with equal opportunity
equal chance to advance and uplift our communities
but instead we getting shot in the head
like a black man life ain't worth a loaf of bread
"stop or i shoot," you stop, they still shoot
buck, buck, buck they stomp you out with steel boots

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

they trying to distract us from our practice
and shackle us up, mentally retract us backwards
attack us like the prophet on the way to damascus
it's like we huddle up, had control of the ball, let 'em sack us
now they overtax us as if they want to collapse us
don't be diluted by this foolishness
30 years old man still want nothing do with this
try to find career and a beer on the weekend
and a freak he could take to the crib on the weekend
suv, xm, heat, only plays the weeknd
only wanna fuck you 5 am with no tweeting
honey's 25 should be working but she's twerking
nobodies tripping she could make money from stripping
and i'm sitting in the back sipping my 'yac
can't help but thinking that "what does her father think of that?"
probably because i got a daughter
i heard money mayweather, he makes it rain without water
he dropped 50 g's at a strip club near the border
a dozen women crawling on all fours up
woah, hey, you should've saw her
you should've took that money to a college campus
but then again, i guess momma needed some pampers
but from my view, these wizards need some pampering
even with a lack of substance
and she wonders why, why, why she can't keep her husband?

we come to unite people
every color, every race
every shape, every face
all around the nation
no discrimination
from generation to generation
(oh, why, why?)

it's getting realer
streets gettin' hotter, i could feel it
who am i to put a gun to another
i'm just trying to show love to my brother
hands up, i just pray to god i make it out
is my life not enough, am i hard to love
if it's america we trusted each other knock me down
and i'm just trying to live it up
only one life to live and i ain't trying to give it up

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why?
...
drip, drip
it's hot outside man (drop, drop) one, two
i know niggas is "thirsty" (boodoodoodooodoodoo)
(bobby digital) one, two
it's hot outside (bo-bo-bo-bo)
about a motherfuckin' hundred degrees, humid
(bo-bobby, yeah, digital)
and niggas is "thirsty" (di-di-di-digital)

ayo, this i dedicate to niggas who bust guns
all my live niggas who sold vamps and didn't "run"
my juveniles wild to stay out past their curfew
a build upon life and drink beers like their pops do
a subject of the streets, yo kid it's "burning season"
don't expose the joint without intentional reason
summer time (digital), dehydrated, niggas out to quench thirst
quench thirst, we might want to stay in home, oh fuck it
rock the camo', i got the ammo
a long shot, look like i play for the knicks
so call me rambo, beretta 9, killarm' recon' (digital)
rob me, i might rob you, then it be on

digital...
radical "white boy" push skate board, not mountain dew
old splash, d'ya see that bright yellow shirt with the wu w?
faced you with the flight of a butter fly wing
fierce as the eagle, sting of the underground beatle
might wobble or fall down inside the squabble
in summer time, cracked the ice cold bottle
take the swallow, and give all praises due to the true
and do the dew, just do the dew, do the dew...
light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
his partner was shady.. tryin to slave the babies

aiyyo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in brooklyn
all this while he let the fiends cook it
the baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
dropped it off in the pj's and they bigged it up
then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
the middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
no clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
the killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
even though her leg was bitten
crackheads point the finger at detective slick morris gittins
paleface cop who done popped the desk
and got the chop on his neck from when he knocked celeste
it was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
some niggaz know him as the godson of gotti
and his black partner, he was scared to speak
he saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
he saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
he saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
they call him desk duty, robocop
younger dudes call him freddy krugs from the way he walk on the block


heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
pulled over his tempo, brenda dropped the endo
had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
they always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
his partner turned red in his waist, mase done smacked her
with the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
he bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
the fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her
she broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
he grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked
more cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
wildest niggaz just smilin cause it look live
they gave her forty years in new orleans, callin me (?)
shorty was young, by three days had a great bid


you're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
you squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
all slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
you sometime me, don't need to remind me about
livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
the bum holdin the door, the mugging no one saw
we played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
and the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
small percentage determined to strengthen they position
transformation from critical to, stable condition
but it still be obstacles on niggaz that's optical
watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
the money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
with they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
whether - hold up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
and for some, another way out, is music and sports
that's why i, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
that won the championship, with just oh on the clock

the fox, is kinda foxy, mr. wolf he's the guy
who chased red through the woods and ate grandma
but a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
unlike the wolf, who made a widower of grandpa

yo, must i flex my cash, to sex yo' ass
i wet the ave. when i set my path
the 'vette don't crash, i'm built to long last
grab my money clip, i hit the bong fast
earn my respect, my checks they better cash
finger on the trigger with my nigga fred glass
knuckles is brass, start snuffin you fast
jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags
next shot go right through your hovercraft
you do the math my answer tounge slash
when will you learn it's return of shaft
the genuine thriller, the miller draft
my force might blur, the porsche'll purr
the apple martini, of course it's stirred
i'll do the honor, the shaolin bomber
shark skin armor, i'll bring the drama


damn, deficatin on the map
wu-tang takin it back, no fakin in the rap
how real is that, you niggaz hatin on the fact
that the kid is blazin this track and hatin on 'em back
my dough's stacked up with o's, who the mack
duckin po'-po's blowin smoke o's in the 'llac
to be exact, don't want no hassle with the stack
in the big apple, we the rotten apples in the back
yeah, it's all grillin, how the fuck y'all feelin?
non-stop park killin, on the block we was killin 'em
the arch villans, when the blood start spillin
any stuck start squealin, body bags we was fillin 'em
yeah, now i got it in the smash
a ounce ya man wanted and a llama in the dash
me and my comrades followin the cash
and livin e'ry day like tomorrow is the last


i'm like the savior dog to ya baby when you're lost out in the snow
like a coyote out on the desert...
where the foxes never go
and the wolf, they never go...

yo, would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it
or would you take it for somethin else and get to' the fuck up
men come together for the common cause
to beat yo' ass, just because
there's a line you don't cross offendin the boss
while of course his one selectin through your head shot
i'm back in the yard again, the bars callin
15 sets of this will have you swollen
ladies like, "damn papa you lookin right
i'd love to give you some of this pussy and i'm a dyke"
i write when the energy's right to spark friction
dj cuttin it, spinnin it back mixin
great pop knock tickin, poetry description
for the motion picture reenactment
activate a higher assassin, keep it classic
rap evolution every black, yo pass that

i grew up on the crime side, the new york times side
stayin' alive was no jive
had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'lo goose
only way i be gettin' the g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this, son
rollin' with this one and that one
pullin' out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smokin' woolas at 16
and runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
makin' my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
stickin' up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better, same damn 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
catchin' keys from 'cross seas
rollin' in mpv's, every week we made forty g's
yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the tec-9
ch-chick-pow! move from the gate now!

it's been twenty-two long hard years, i'm still strugglin'
survival got me buggin', but i'm alive on arrival
i peep at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed; i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
tryin' to get a clutch at what i could not
the court played me short, now i face incarceration
pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turned i learned life is hell
livin' in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes givin' chase
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed, and i ask: what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
and stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be livin' proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
and ain't tryin' to hear what i'm kickin' in his ear
neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
that what? that life is hectic

cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all
cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money

i knew this chick by the name of vevorine
who introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game
we did in the rain, on the hood of a range
but vevorine, had a special friend called heroin
she told me, that's how she met ray charles and marvin gaye
but back then, i ain't gon' front, i was peddling 'caine
in the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no
cause it's a poor man's girl, and i will never give love
to how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was
martin had a dream, nigga, i did too
to make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoup
so, i took it that thaw, and hit the street
with bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
momma said, never get high on your own supply
especially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich
reminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears
see the more money that comes in, the more i disappear
fresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear
new year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear
watch this strip, make me back it up, d'angelo knows the feeling
off that needles warm embrace, in a sexual heeling
this tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
i'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past
baby, you gotta trust me, cause i gotta girl and you got a man
i don't want you to judge me, i just wanna be your friend
baby, you gotta trust me...

aiyo i live by the rules, trust nothing in skirts
cause with that big butt and a smile, she be waiting to flirt
with a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt
another dick in the jaw, more dick in the george
while you home sleeping, she creeping, you thinking it's yours
that's just how women is, i reminisce
on when i had to learn from experience, why they call you a bitch
and i ain't the best, but i ain't never denied
tell me what nigga, flow sicker, spit shit better than mine
the plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time
you get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine
i'm on the grind, i don't settle for mines, nigga
with this track, a broad, with a pack, before i peddle a dime
line for line, whose the best artist, the rest y'all garbage
but it's awkward, it's ass backwards, they still spinning your garbage
it's me, blunt: the artist, y'all niggaz is garbage

sweat jackets valor, rap money, looking like crack money
relax, money, niggaz, it's raw, sweet aromatic
backwood, fanatic nigga, this is cali
vigilante's tattered, the wife beaters and khakis
i'm taking over, cause y'all, cooking too much baking soda
b12, rock selling niggaz vacation's over
medallion's guaca', only rock a three piece suit
whenever holding case, the cops try to stop us
my henchmen behind me, in black benz's with big toppers
get up on my life, nigga, the kid's proper
wrist glint, the big shit, cult following fans be vixen
this is grown man business, pay attention
or lay your position, fuck around and have a fatal collision
the moment where you should of made your decision
i made it, i'm living, i'm paid and i'm winning
from the aid of my wisdom, i created a system
i despise your killing, and raping
you're... despicable

are you, my judge?

it's just... you should be punished
i'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

used by backup singers in atlantic city bands
niggaz look on, and get hooked on this mic line

lp's delivered with style and potential
niggaz flowin smoothly in a sequential
order, revealin hidden tape recorders
stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura


twist the dac up, them niggaz with math is back up

mailed by the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
bout the group recruit we scoop up cream like breyer's
then spread across the globe like telephone wires
thirty-six assorted, shaolin imported
chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
time for royalty audit
fabulous establishment metabolism, blackfoot indian
cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
then grew to a physical body with five meridians
as the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
i got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
and politic with leo and russell
when niggaz is still rushin we'll brush you

he's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives


thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
ignite, blowin the mic to arabian heights
as i recite this medley, niggaz couldn't fuck with the
deadly ground i hold down
classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
panic and confusion echoes through the building
continuing to build, i strive for perfection
driven by the will to live, glocks i hold
shots i give, while searchers of rescue teams
look for means of survival and who's liable
for this harrowing experience
you scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
and proceeds of the wu-tang academy
to fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery

number two, chao san poi

no matter the crime, i'm beating the case

the way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
s.k., no stungun, smooth devices
time crisis, i played the game, low lifers

the baby automatic kill like air force strikers
i'm still asiatic when i spill the hypeness

the dark, and this place will come here
that's right!

"it has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose..somewhere in outer space."

"the mysteries of creation are there."

"up in the sky?" "up in the sky."

and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.
and therefore as we set sail; we ask god's blessing -
on the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure
of which man has ever embarked."

"prepared for liftoff."

i self lord and master, shall bring disaster to evil factors
demonic chapters, shall be captured by kings
through the storms of days after
unto the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
the brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
word to the father, and mother earth
seeking everlasting life through this hell for what it's worth
look listen and observe
and watch another c-cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
the righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
cannot afford to be confined to a cell
brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers little daddy street preacher
illustrious feature, narrator you select
accompanied by deck plus the dj you respect
the seven and a half combine, over the frontline
the ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
infinite skills create miracles
warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

yeah; i leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
wild like rock stars who smash guitars
poison bars from the gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
invade your zone, ruin like ancient rome
i span the universe and return to earth to claim my throne
the maker, owner, plus soul controller
ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
stand like collossus, regardless to whom or what
numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
who but us, to supply you with the fire?
the burning truth, 150 absolut proof
on the mic like moses spoke in golden scribe
survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
i notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
when we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world - we could have conquered it

drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on sunday?
while the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
all those who couldn't multiply were sent back
no tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
brought to a halt from a front full assault
the chemist left the lab with undetermined results
they saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
the audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
the archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
it was layin' in the zip drive from chest five

fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
women walk around celibate, livin irrelevant
the most benelovent king, communicatin through your dreams
mental pictures been painted, allah's heard and seen
everywhere, throughout your surroundin atmosphere
troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere

understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenemants
eighty-five percent tenants depend on welfare recipients
stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
at night i walk through, third eye is bright as a street lamp
electric microbes, robotic probes
taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated
blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
exaggerated authorization, food and drug administration
testin poison in prison population
my occupation to stop the innauguration of satan
some claim that it was reagan, so i come to slay men
like bartholemew, cause every particle is physical article
was diabolical to the last visible molecule
a space night like rom, consume planets like unicron
blasting photon bombs from the arm like galvatron

were holding guns, we take flight with no fright
and attack, never fear cause our words is clear
what's been done can't be undone son, we can't care
cause the last days and times are surely here
snakes and flakes get blown, by the rightous ones
divine minds bind, we unified as one
half of black hope, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
our everlastin answers stay flyin over egypt


for you to defeat, the gods

i opened it, seen the god holdin his kids
photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
plus he dropped one, oh shit, here come his old earth
with no shoes on, screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
she fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
plus the blue coats, officer lough, took it as a joke
weeks ago he strip-searched the god and gave him back his coke
bitches yellin, beenie man swung on helen
in the back of a cop car, dirty tarts are tellin
but suddenly a chill came through it was weird
felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
laid on the stretcher, blood on his wally's like ketchup
deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
it can't be, from yohoo to lee's
second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
he was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten


now what my man is trying to tell y'all
is that across the whole globe (you can never)
the murder rates is increasin, and we decreasin (you can never)
so at the same time, when you play with guns
when you play with guns son (you can never defeat)
that causes the conflict of you goin against your own (the gods)

straight up and down, cause this is only a story
from the real

gambino cappacino to the afro sheen
stay black, where i'm at, high road to rap council
splash love to wu in a orderly tonsil
never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
forced in the world 'donna nuclear freeze
through the damage to the wannabe flipmode and def squad
ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
if you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
my word of mouth it's all real wigs might peel
livin large and in charge branch out bon voyage
twenty-four diamond government named god
alias daryl hill bring thugs back to kill
circle around my son, daryl jr. never eatin large
auntie dauntie sixteen holdin me down
aids of rap music may be contagious to sound
verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
method forcin j-love to bring the pain from underground
realizin food for thought is self-compromisin
shaolin cut the crack into a triple-o sizin
blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
hopin i catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel

crackhead niggaz get stitches
so what up with that kid, danger when i attack kid
watch how the slang hits you, just like the fat kid
form another pyramid, look how we slid
all over park hill, stapleton politic
on a twenty dollar bill all in it together
you can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean?

googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
the angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
already did what i was gonna do before you even got the mic

we left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
interaction with the wise and civilized
the mind caused matter to fall into a center
a great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
from out of this collision
the central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
each drop full of hip hop energy
balanced on all sides such great symmetry
the bars unlocked the power of the stars
the mirror in the telescope pinpoint the gods
from a distance, acting as a guiding coach
analyze the board, universal approach
retune the soul to a certain pitch
changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
the love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
respect for the intellect and broad discovery

easy with the flicks, baby, i'm camera shy

get that money, god, keep your sword sharp (1-2-3-4)

we might have to 8 diagram one of y'all mc's
we grind everyday and we hustle for cheese
got our face on the front of cd's, we off the hook
w.t.c. y'all soft and shook
y'all not built like the cuban linx clan that get cream
and back heads down every time we sing
give us a hundred grand for a show, let us rock
for more money, more chicks, more private stock

they call me streetlife, slap the taste
out ya mug, know ya place, you ain't thug, fix ya face
throw a slug, catch a case
meanwhile, beat trial, back on that cash cow
getting cream, however, a street brother know how
point blank, i'm pulling rank, calling shot, i got bank
pass the rock, my hand's hot, hit 'em with the showshotter
peace to my ala mater, wu-tang block scholars
never settle for less, promoters pay us top dollar

the clan'll talk, calabama niggaz all'll quit
talking that short dick shit, we was s'posed to be cool
only the clue's on the other end of the stick
somebody let the monkeys out the cage
over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
chickenhead skeezer crackrock hoodrat
somebody let the monkeys out the cage
barney here is down to a feeding dreadlock
armpit like two buckwheat's in a headlock
macy gray's hair between your leg lock
somebody let the monkeys out the cage
ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
somebody let the monkeys out the cage
somebody let the monkeys out the cage
over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
chickenhead skeezer crackhead hoodrat
somebody let the monkeys out the cage
ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
calabama niggaz all'll quit
talking that short dick shit
speak up, no loud speaker but i'm speaking loud
venacular ass kicking, truth got there in crowd
shit, they call me the lethal lip
the linguistic, full metal jacket of venacular ballistic
shooting out at the mouth without chap or blistec
here's a mothafucka, i didn't flunk diaper rash
i'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, hollow point tongue
dum dum, pow, shot from gattling gums
hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
malicious, with malice and mayhem
fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and i'll slay
them and literally poetic symptoms
pissing me the fuck off, missing me with that shit
i stick a venacular foot so far up in ya ass
you won't be able to pass verbal gas
so far in ya ass that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
and you drown of a poetic ass kicking
leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
that hung on my big toe, as i flow upward
kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
cavity in ya best rhyme, and i'm the access on the rest
call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
with the drill, i got lyrical skills
i could perform oral root canals
it's unwise to fuck with me
kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
leaving you to choke
on where it hurts, unspoken vocals
tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
with toe jamming and ya mothafucking hemmoroids
fuck the dumb shit...
after laughter, comes tears


yo check yo yo, check the script
me and the gods get it ripped
blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
had a box, 'boom boom' the bass will blast
we was laughing, at all the girls that passed
conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(hey yo, ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
cause i dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
not knowin, exactly what lied ahead
my little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
get the wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
"hey shorty, check it for the bag and the dough"
but he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "no!!"
money splattered him, bow! then he snatched the bag
in his pockets, then he jetted up the ave.
girls screamin, the noise up and down the block
(hey, rakeem!) what? (your little brother got shot!)
i ran frantically, then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
i picked him up, then i held him by his head
his eyes shut, that's when i knew he was...
aw man! how do i say goodbye?
it's alway the good ones who have to die
memories in the corner of my mind
flashbacks, i was laughin all the time
i taught him, all about the bees and birds
but i wish i had a chance to sing these three words



me and my man, my ace big moe from the shelter
bout to hit the skins, from this girl named thelma
now thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
every girl from shaolin dissed her respect
we was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
moe said he'll go first, i said i'll take next
here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
he seemed to ignore, i said be for real
she's not even worth it, to go raw deal
a man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
he got butt-naked and stuck the power u
twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
i'm not pumpin' up, i am, airin out
hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
i'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
but he carried on, with the same old stuff 
with stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
both tried to be down with o.p.p.
ain't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the h.i.v. now
no life to live, doc says two more years
so after the laughter, i guess comes the tears

hi, dad, you mustn't forget not that you promised while we are eating you'd tell a story

i'll, i'll tell you something later.. something strange happening in the martial arts world

good, tell me then!

every year, many famous fighters are gathering. the story is:

what are you doing in shaolin? who are you? let's have your leg!

the wu-tang clan, now the wu-tang warriors...

quiet! do you know where you are? show all respect

i know that i've come into a tiger's den
but then, i came to catch tigers, right

if you lay a sword on him, i'll kill you

because you fight now, then you'll lose

who says?

i say it

just kill him!

no, you can't kill him
that's my job

i want the man dead, then he dies
yo, yo, yo, what up kid? yo, these niggaz is back, son
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) i'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga
yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, i seen it like a zenith, man
you hear me man? word up, man, ya'll know what it is
it's on again, man, for real, top gun, what what

aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants
the new range is super-charged, i remains intelligent
back to the formula, lord, hard grammar
this is god school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up
excalibur swords, t-rexes, bibles of rhymes
we in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast
polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp
hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps
back to the dormatory, where niggas
broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory
true holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade
so when i wave it, you gon' say rae mad
now it's 28 days later, now wu's up, do something, you can't
it's blood in my eye, i might get amped
to rip something down, the billboard holders is back
so when you see me, you gon' say he gets down

from darkness to dna, i move with my brother
and we resonate, energy that shifts in colors
bringing mc's punishment, then i'm done with it
the meter leave way on the fast break, i run with it
it was not a hobby, but a childhood passion
that had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned
every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
check the total amount of mc's inflicted
with torture, from moving with work that's restricted
we criticize producers til they joints are right
then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
with explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen 
drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old
down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano

blitz like the green bay packers, sack like the linebackers
hang with niggas, like redneck crackers
strangle cold bottles of beck's, like a vexed german
duck low behind the car, my tech burning
neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight
absorbed, in the grill, big pun like
lord of the wu-tang sword, know what that means?
like j.r. tolkien, it's the lord of the rings
this is my man, chef, auto, like grand theft auto
the 18th letter, followed by the mark of zorro
plus a, not for apple, but i pack an apple
shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle
caramel, pecan, sundae, pregline
plump breasts, was filled with saline
her big booty cousin, nasty nadine
get you on the floor, whore tried to double team

is he still that nucca? is he in the hood like that?
is he really strapped? will he really split yo' shit?
i thought you said he rap? pull up in the yard, ten sets
he ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding
who testing? rope-a-dope his black lotus
can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue
duck when the axe is swinging, wild apache drum
crazy horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit
can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room
space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker
voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener
swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel
unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional
to the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in
yo, yo
yeah, come on

baby you do, oh

new york's finest
plush whips and rollies, ice chains and stogies
no bitch could hold me, in this thug world

i hold it with the bolo grip, solo control the strip
behold, p.l.o. the click, man, it's over with
so quick, notice how we bang with the knuckles bare
wu-tang, keep it fresh like tupper ware
the jungle, animal house, gat in your mouth
polly with the wild life, cannibal out
give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette
or with the mask on, peelin' the tech
killah hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
annamette with the top down, wheelin' the 'vette
scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids
twist a blunt in front of jake and still mash on the strip
face sick with the rap shit, stacking them chips
in the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips
bad bitch with the black six, after my dick
she like, this your pussy, and she smash my click
not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
niggaz straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
snake waiting, dudes came for sure, i lay law
stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
see my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
we be foaming at the mouth, even, i doubt we leave without eating
so without reason, pounds are squeezing
the lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and cream
bitches ride like the scream machine
for a taste of it, the chick strip, clean out the jeans
next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams

if real niggaz is listening, the life we living in, is wrong
(witty wu-tang is unpredictable, witty wu-tang is unpredictable)
back for transitions, to save us from harm
we in the race for time... so we won't lose our mind
but if we run the race like a thug
we would lose that mind that we made of

you kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill
liable to pull a knife from out of his heal
snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
one finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand
you'll be hoping you'd be spidey, to get away from this
you be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed
one man, can't uplift the land
like method man standing on the hands of fans
see the captain and lieutenants, true descendant
splendid, unprecidented, hip hop vintage
started from the park benches, before the narcs could snitch us
he was god cypher divine, trying to spark the wizzes

yo, rated x, smack you off the stage when i'm vexed
no sweat, i crack a cold case of beck's
guess whose back, the jack of all trades is next
the rap cuisine, i crack a raw egg and flex
i cave in your chest, this one came from the jets
yeah, the cause and effect, make innocent blood pour
the streets is like the rap game, a daily tug of war
for rich or for poor, or death do us part, niggaz come for test

still grimey (grimey, grimey)
still slimey (slimey, slimey)
don't try me (try me, try me)
it's been ten long years, you can't untie me

bring fire and ruck let the heat pour
niggaz like ruck 'fuck you rhyming to this beat for?'
listen, life is like a muthafuckin' seesaw
one minute you're hot, the next, your rep drops
none of your biz, fuck around, and run in your crib
wife like 'he ain't here', throw some to your wiz
niggaz running up on me, til the tre' pound click
talking 'bout 'ruck, let's battle' on some 8 mile shit
i'm like; nigga, my name ain't b. rabbit
it's sean price, big ruckus from busting these ratchets
call me gay basher, for fucking up these faggots
ya'll niggaz ain't nothing, stop fronting, stay passive
yo, pass the dutch, on the left hand side
sean gone til november, stole wyclef's ride
bob backlund, car jacking, new jersey driving
ya'll niggaz ain't think about rapping, til you hear me rhyming, oh


i keeps it real in the field, navy feel on the drill
never stingy with my bills, plenty gravy i spilled
recorded in the history of rap, two inch reels
seven to ten mills, eleven to twenty hills
rest in peace to my brother half-a-mil
unnecessary blood spilt, another thug killed
move with the mass appeal, the blast still
for the cash money click, no limits and no thrills
mad cuz your hoe, feeling p. sunzini, give you
as sweet as a kiwi, face it, you not me, nigga
ladi dadi, the gods like to party
we don't cause trouble, but we can make you a body
ladi dadi, the sunn likes to party
i don't cause trouble, but i will make you a body
flowin' high in the mazarati, two with my ninjas beside me
lively, floating on some ducatti's
with two gellati's, two hotties, we never sloppy
jewelry rocky, spanish pieces, they call me papi
clear fire bacardi, sobered up like gotti
rest in peace to my dog, shotti, shotti


on the corner ready to bo', holding my nuts
standing by my building looking at myself in the truck
my reflections... (still grimey)
oscar the grouch's worms (still slimey)
i got a jones for miss piggy's ham hiney
i can be a bum in the slums, and slam shiny
on every corner, i'm grams, you can find me
the boss of the burners, i fire shots if your nine speak
this is true manchu, and who you, fams too?
better have they face in the game, like the blue man group
i heard you smell me, i make it funky
rock hard and kick ass like, i hate you donkeys
my oatmeal lumpy like johnson's bumpy, harlem humpty
hungry wolves, pain's hummer, harbor hungry
dumpty, blazing trees, now leave an o.e. present
know why the hood feel me, like police presence

yeah, yeah, it's live, it's live, it's going down

my third eye, never blind, deep behind assassins
taurus is the sign, for the dimes that be asking
william burk, with a mind that's advanced
and put in work, spread knowledge of outlasting
sharpshooter with a luger, blasting at lucifer
asking the trooper of earth to ride jupiter
medusa the ruler of wicked women and timid men
we killing cops til they free my nigga killa sin
and licking shots in the battle when the war begin
wrath of the prominent, all hail the gods again
reign of the dominant, we looking for osama bin
laden, plotting on the fall of evil rotten men

on your most beloved, why i come down from regions undiscovered
i have you hovered over by black brothers in public, it's rugged
my fatal wound, you not immune, i'm departing like king arthur
open hand combat is unlimited, i'm the tomcat, word
the old war calling maserati with the spoiler
carry middle east oil and hot water boilers
cop pull bars from nato, eating fried green tomatoes
we will bake your head like it's mr. potato
me and reverend burk is like green hornet and kato
godfather, the clan man, don't you turn fredo
calm like sippin' top sake, northern vodka hanna

the steels unbendable, it's not recommendable
to defend the rule, we come up, we finish you
cuz then the liquid sword will strike down, diminish you
your fate like the bottom of an old worn tennis shoe
i'm just skinning you, not aiming for ending you

just like black shoe fit
if you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
make it brief son, half short and twice strong
no doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
it was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
lace mc's with styles when they rhyme drunk
on a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
eight diagram sword swinga armored tank force
rza throw in the disc but then change the bank source
you can't flow, must be the speech impediment
you got lost off the snare off impeach the president
whether in amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
this witty unpredictable shot is critical
to analytical analogy, insurance policies why
said he know that sounds define the note
couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
too many dope niggaz i see starvin
catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
a fugitive bass playin rap czar
smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar



tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly
what the fuck i mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty
deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin
the ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
prone to drops ya, slash ya, rip shit up
got this whole thing tang mastered, sho nuff
an mc too good to be touched, john john
bring the phenomenon, i cold crush
mc, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
as we move on, saga unfold
captivated by a saga that go untold, like goldfinger
caught up in a cliffhanger
yo i-n-s another code red, danger, break out the vest
now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
don't ever roam, in the naked city
eight fingers stories none pretty
bomb em wit the witty unpredictable, conditionin be critical
peace to tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
is a toast to your memory
when i go how many niggaz gon' remember me

the heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
the fists are the arrows, the body is the bow
all movements have to be....

i'm the 7 in the center of the sun, i keep shinin
my inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds
that be twinklin, while my love be sprinklin
we stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin
allah's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious
seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless
embraces all races, all caste and all cases
in every spec of life he's the substance of all traces


the answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions
of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection
who gives you all and never ask more of you
the faithful companion that fights every war with you
before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical
he's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle
a mission impossible, purely philosophical
but you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital


and as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil
like armies of ants carrying stones of soil
building a home for themselves and storing food
at night we praise allah and adore the moon
in sync like the flow of the nile, the growth of a child
only fearin' god, we great a ghost with a smile
that which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh
meaning life has no partnership with death


yo, i've been highly misunderstood by those who met us
they had ears of corn and heads of lettuce
mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings
and eventually pledge their allegiance
to that which was against them and exempt them from the truth
then juiced them and pimp them ??
so the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies
bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
trying to harness the wind
allah's the father from without and within
on christ return, who will announce him?
every tree is numbered, but who can count them?
the name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?
allah is the father of all, why do you doubt him?


the heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
the fists are the arrow, the body is the bow
all movements have to be ??
the wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful
fast, high kicks, a good firm stance
avoid the enemy's strong points
people have told me
you have ways of killing without dealing a mob
well so have i

yeah, come on, what's the deal?

yo, pockets is fat like the good year blimp
hollow heads is sterilized in paroxide, waiting for you
faggot niggas to jump off, your bullshit throne
so i can offer you a tummy tuck
see your stomach is stapled, it's on
it's dangerous down my alley, dog
it's like the halls and i'm outy, dog
hear the shanks scratching the gate?
see the god tone standing here for dolo, give you an '89 whooping
leave your body looking like you was raped
and don't ever come at me sideways, hands in your pocket
cuz i will turn to steven segal, rip your arm out your socket
ya'll little niggas watch it, i do this for free
knocking rappers out, trust me, over a clown, i'm not here to make a profit
nigga, if this was the arts, it be the best kung fu
and i'm tone yao chin, serving ya'll wonton soup
i do shit like disarm a group, drink a 40 with him
and tell ya'll niggas stay the fuck out my loot

my nina, my nine-ah, medina, marauder
sabrina, discard her, redeem her, for allah
supreme architecture, the beat spark connector
inject in my serum, infiltrate in your sector

bobby steels keep steels concealed, be still
leave you fifty shot banana clips with free refils
guns bursting, one person is curtains for certain
most often fill coffins, no nursing or surgeons
is needed, bloods depleated, your body deleted
like unsaved wav files, no way to retrive it
best believe it, frosting the cat
i remember that, my moms put gunpowder inside my similac
my brain is untamed, some claim, that's stunning strangers
cuz of my basement, i keep studios in gun ranges
plus, i got more g's than sicily
pizzeria rotisserie, burn mc's out they misery


aiyo, ghost, these niggas pussy, mind that take mine
i feel you, form on 'em, yeah, i ain't sharping nothing

niggas want war, i invite all cordialy
they assed out morally, how they in skinny jeans
and never fix they mouth to even fucking go to war with me
oh, that's how you feel, then handle that accordingly
lay 'em out, bounce before the jake is even on to me
lay back in the crib, your bitch give me orally
i don't want beef, i'm like pookie, this is caling me
i ain't with that twitter shit, nigga try to follow me
watch you get hit like the mega million lottery
i don't got time to be, playing with you faggots

so, these killings
when are they gonna come to an end?
will he ever finish?
probably the next to see, he must find the lizard


you just asked me, when will it end?
hahahahaha, well let me tell you
once an evil deed is done, then it never ends
it goes on, and it will go on forever...
watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it
get it, get it, get it, get it,
and so as bobby...
and so as bobby...
and so as bobby start to learn more jewels of life
he became more the wiser, and the rza was being manifested from within
for a new embryo, had been born through the cypher
bringin' forth into existence, the ruler zig-zag-zig allah
and he started to spit shit like this

yo, happy new year, throw on your wu-wear
we true here, you crab derelict bastards, you can't push through here
the ice melter, you best to to dive for ya shelter
this a sign, when it's called alpha phi sigma phi delta
digi tech, 36 tech, eject pelet
rip through rap cadet, no one left to tell it
then them hook, walked through justice in brooks
scotch whiskey, in the middle of patty, with four glocks wit me
hand pull trigger nigga, 16-shot dart spitta
chart splittas, who walk through the hood, heart bitter
for industriliazed rapped capatilist, trynna snatch a crack of this
bza bitch, please don't make me flip, flip, flip, flip

and bones get sparked, my wiz as strong as joan of arc

while ya dogs just bark, bark, bark
we spread this attitude, to every point of latitude
every street crevest, every quarter, every avenue
i might be on the iffel, wit a 30/30 scope riffler
ready to snipe you, and wipe you from the face of the earth
you can taste it diverse, the blood thirst
i start to bring the great flood, first, first, first

so as his mind start to grow
he start expression himself through his hip hop culture
changin' his thoughts, standin' on his truth of square

build it better himself to those around him
and he start talkin like this...
hungry men have no respect for law or authority
or human life, a man's bread and butter is only
insured if he works for it
leadership means everything, pain, blood and death
what night is to day, man is to woman
and woman is to man, fear is the state of nervousness
only fit for children, not men
all men are created equal, so to offend man, is to offend god
fear is lose control of one third, if you become like a helpless deer
or a feathless bird, we stand as the true of living, living true
and these jewels, thoughts of great wise men, like marcus garvey
start to build up inside bobby's head
and it lead him to the knowledge of himself
and he became a strong muthafucka!
"peace god"
"peace to the gods"
"how you god?"
"studyin one-twenty right now"
"mmmm"
"call me back at the god hour"

it's just the new way of thinkin

a bag of sess, playing chess, yes
my thoughts be sneaky like a crook from brooklyn
when you ain't looking, i take the queen with the rook then
i get vexed, laying phat tracks on ampex

i was basically leaving the hustle life. you know, going to night school striving to get a diploma and transitioning to a legitimate lifestyle. that's what my life was like at that point when i met gza. he mentioned he had family and brothers in staten island that were putting this movement together, this wu-tang thing. so one day he invites me to go to the studio with him. i didn't go because i had to go to night school that evening. so the next day he had a tape of what they did the night before. and that tape was an unfinished version of "protect yo neck." when i heard that, everything just became crystal clear now. i never missed another studio session after that. whenever he told me he was going somewhere i was there. it inspired me to sit down. let me just see if i can write something. i've never written a rhyme before this. so that's what i did. i basically rehearsed that one rhyme, that one rhyme until i mastered it 

"you remember the rhyme?"

it was the "mystery of chessboxin'" one

lifeless activity, constant movement
buyin' elasticity, such improvement
sword held to where it collapses inward
spillin' rhymes if it's shaolin vineyards
rza had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
co-author rewrote the scripture
math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
amplified in the time machine of early earth
a two-way radio, simple yet complex
receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts

if i could, i would, if i can't, i won't
please forgive me if i don't
should, some should be
i come from the strangest streets
i come from the place where love and danger meets
a house full of noisy kids, boys avoiding bids
unemployed, on skid row, we had no toys for kids
we would bang our thumbs, gunshots, they run
we would bang on drums made from garbage cans
even garbageman make more than mom
they make more than teachers, next door the preachers
they were sure they would reach us but we'd never listen
niggas drunk and pissing on the side of the building
can't provide for children, someone stop the squealing
turned to drugs for healing, thug sneaking and killing
cop sirens are screaming, inside the cars, we dreaming
one day we could own one, right now we can't bump crumbs
my brother would sell jawns, my mother would yell, "son
you'll end up in jail, son, or dead or in hell, son"
but what could she tell son?
that money excel, son
tony got knocked up, now looking for bail, son
making collect calls, expecting that mail, son
doing pushups in a six by four cell, son
a hard head makes a soft tail, son
and my little brother on that same trail, son

life is a puzzle, every day is a struggle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things my big brother do
life's a struggle, we get trapped in this puzzle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things i saw my brother do

loaded guns in the shoebox, fingerprints on the ooh-wop
ziploc plastic bags with black and blue tops
we slung on the block and watch out for the blue coats
ses blunts we pas after two tokes
starving for a g-note back, and forth on the ferry boat
coming up from poverty, we were very broke
to twenty-eight grams, expand to a thousand grams
reap the twenty dollar bills passed through a thousand hands
multi-project apartments, spots bubbling
never went to clubs with less than a dozen men
recruiting young gunners and runners, let my cousin in
spot gets knocked, my brother locked the fuck up again
another mama's son stuck in the fucking pen
to disperse, no one to trust, back to struggling
now i'm on the streets trying to get my hustle in
cheap wine guzzling, life is so puzzling

life is a puzzle, every day is a struggle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things my big brother do
life's a struggle, we get trapped in this puzzle
and we ignore the ones who truly loves you
as we do foolish things we see the others do
i try to do the same things i saw my brother do

i'm from the home where the buffalo roam

leave your eyes wide shut
money bag's on +the table+, gots to get locked up
rebel i's simply slicker, pick up a pretty sister
dig her out on +the table+, bend off the remy licker
head splitter, deliver so cold i send shivers
from many figures, battle the world or any nigga

it's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
blow off them matches and sit up with you
aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
slingin' coke is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
if we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
nines crowns verses your nine towns
run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down

one of these days and you wont be long {yo} (that's what you call it pa)
one of these days and you wont be long {yo, yo}

i come from the slums, i ain't no dummy
my testiment talk, represent money
this +verbal intercourse+, fueled by exhaust
the bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
no remorse, endorse the rap artist
so flamboyant cos i pimp slap the hardest
ever since the +triumph+ we've been missin' them soldiers
we came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
bulldose through the rubbish, i'm in too deep boy
i just gotta love this, they call we too sweet
one of the nine brothers, i'm so unique
every line that smother, the situation's grim
it's bloody sin cos every time i want out they pull me back in
i see my reflection in the chrome mack 10
ask the passer who's faster with the pen
then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
that's how i like it, sweat on my wine bottles
the automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
the endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
veteran smile, +dat's gangsta+ shit, that american style
dig it, prick or prey
i'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga

"i got to know"

explosive, baby, comin' at you
(y'all mothafuckas know..
the next chamber's the mothafuckin' weather)
look out for the stingers, bab
yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
for all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
victims of wordly ways, memories stays engraved
all my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
the young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
in this new world the order slaughter men, women, and children
ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
the projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
vivid thoughts, devils resort to trick knowledge
they kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
i know the pain the game bring, i did the same thing
spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
it's hard to keep control, i bless those who seek a scroll
trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
not a role model, i walk a hard road to follow
i sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
the gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
their life and times, deadly like the virus design
but too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way

a voice cries from the wilderness of the north
a representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
or other divisions of the family structure
youths are injected with serums that leads
to skin irritations, babies being born with
disfigurations, experimentations
on their faces there bear world relations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
it lightly begins to rain screams of terror
are hidden by the passing trains
this can't be little hussein, his uncle cried
as he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
bitter sickness, and left us to witness

yeah, yo
curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
tree of life, more precious than wu is golden game
the wise self flourish inherit, halls of fame
crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
while we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
it's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
zero process, progress, become the hunted
america's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
some love the speed, some satisfy a need
some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
the strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
one flew astray, and then caught my little seed
can it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife
the righteous man would be within these stripes pipes
take in my energy, breath and know the rest
cause the good die young and the hard die best

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way

y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
while your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
the whole projects is trapped in stench
you either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
new world order slave trade, minimum wage, medicaid
can a devil fool a muslim nowadays
inside my lab, i'm going mad
took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
the blue is for the crips, the red is for the bloods
the whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe

as we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
mama say, take your time young man and build your own
don't wind up like your old dad
still searching for them glory days he never had
so many bad want to scheme for american dream, no more kings
the cash rule everything now, we going down
these babies looking up to us, it's up to us
the million man march mc's, get on the bus
but envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
no longer, brothers, we unstable
like kane when he slew abel, killing each other

you can't party your life away
drink your life away
smoke your life away
fuck your life away
dream your life away
scheme your life away
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
cause your seeds grow up the same way
black knights
west coast killa bee kill
black knights, black knights
you hear it from the distance

(yo) my brain sprouts branches blossoming tragic thoughts
takes bully lyrics lunch money, pistols or microphone
welcome to l.a. battle the unexplained
scarecrows and apples meet mr. constrictus
concrete knuckles and scuffles, i waste groups
give 'em lumps the size of footballs, bricks and grapefruit
make soup, blueberry while dining with classic monsters
better check my sponsor chop before you can answer
brothers in the contra, bullet holes in the stop sign
gods in the neighborhood, pistol in the sunset
lyrics, the bitch pressed dump trucks with one thrust
faster than sound, light, or speed that your gun busts
among us, west coast wreck hopes, infect dope
whining 'cause your last holocaust cassette broke
the hunchback tic-tac heads come to get you
nine-hundred and forty-three missiles made of crystal
light a match to those, the crowd put all their lighters up
stomp through the graveyard in the rain, the architect
bricks in the mud, the cold weather is scorchin
for boxcar children and orphans, wrote a portrait
chewing on cactus, rappers better practice
slimey like a catfish, dollers in the mattress
a hand-carved pipe from baton rouge to cherokee
grand-high count, feed macadamias to parakeets
french lemonade, skeletons on the highway
clove, gets rowdy i'll box my way out
poor righteous teacher, devils better fear us
or my pistol splatter your brains accross the mirrors

bluntz, martinez, girls, and gunz (gunz)

gut 'em like a fish, the man who bled marbles
bloody mr. fixit, holocaust and guns
stumbled through the doorway wearing my evening chains
real as the hallway red and blue crayolas
now leaving stains, architect from cali
rumble through the mist covered valleys, dirty alleys
crumbs in your suitcase, ice fishing with pelicans
big 'ole tackling skeleton, you're irrelevant
riding jeweled elephants, california horizon
track mud through the kitchen, murder henchmen
strange man's pockets, cigarettes and candy
walk with a limp, chance of a lifetime

to understand the language of flowers

forms circles like the rings of saturn
dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
a wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
a wild fire engulfing every home
it's history, chiseled and carved in every stone
a workshop where skills are learned
handcrafted and drafted, written works our main concern
urban center provided with a social structure
and a curious culture full of superconductors
each stain is part of a scene with
intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
a place where the forgotten art is so powerful
a striking image is something that's so valuable

most heated battles, i've blasted mc's
some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
wu entered on the level, then we would wait and listen
while one flashed metal, eight calculate position
the world snapped, once we combined our rap
drastic measures, priceless treasures on nap'
our swords swing, windchill mount aerie
native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
snares and kicks, off the project bricks
it's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
the warning came unnoticed, it's like the shot "on the dock of the bay"
that slayed otis, the nine-lotus
each one adjust to his own environment
formulate this great lp, a hundred rounds spent
niggas bent on a fruitless search for nourishment
they long for this proper guidance encouragement


it be the lost tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
the uncontrolled substance got me spittin up nuff bars, disgustin

talent all natural, rock with the bangles of hip-hop
mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness

captured on tape is precious, bless mic pure defness
awaken from you sleep mistake

gza, ras kass, yeah (what's up, wu-universal)
legendary...

now it's the real beginning of the pages of shams
spit that heat rock, that make fiends make vapors of grams
sham's is the greatest fan, rock big cables of sands
valleys and trunks, i got the mack ten
we can hit the alley with iron and thumper
take it to the hands like the brand new leonard
niggaz goin' no mas, when the bullets go in him
you dealing with a night stick toker
the ice pick poker, trust, you ain't like this joker
and the set, devoted to opening your neck
with the tech, as you sit in a lex'
your next move, is slipping, your last move is shitting
as your body gets soft, the shotty went off
little soldiers, you're out of position
guns go off, shams is a greatest fan
a rhyming gallop reporter, columns are lost
white five, black five, with dollars to toss
twisted by the dark side of the force
black biscuit, by park side in a porsche
you're off sides in the fort
we are survivors of the war of good and evil
i'm in the hood, in the hood with a desert eagle
with my brooklyn peoples, now feel it...

darkman, my persona's like tony montana
how we used to sniff coke, how i puff marijuana
try, play me today, i'm a kill you manana
from, far with the k, or up close with the llama
i'm like an african king in a castle in guana
chest dripping with jewels, one hell of a rhymer
study lessons in athena, building with an old timer
so i, always been wise ever since a young minor
get cream by any means, follow malcolm x theme
so i'm often posted, in a rumor with that thing
got a limited support from the sing sing regime
i'm hannibal smith and they like the a-team
keep my head on the swivel, when i serve a dope fiend
upgraded, to a digital, from a triple beam
fucking with me, you better be real as you can be
la trapacanti, a well known rhyme general

who say ras kass don't spit fire, he a liar
that's like your favorite rap star claiming he gon' retire
when you mention me, not about penitentiary
wins and rhyme skills, both twenty second century
ahead of my time, school niggaz like timbuktu
cause i'm original, like rap feeling the jewel
galosh is by b.u.f.u., by us fuck you,
try us, fuck you, you die, y'all got gats, but him buck too, nigga
sip the grey goose, and conned it, they know the room service
in hotel rwanda, reminder to honor these street scholars
who ask why u.s. defense is twenty percent of the tax dollar
bush gave 6.46 billion to halle burton
for troops support efforts in iraq
meanwhile, the hood is hurting, please believe that
the rape over, chaney talking, 25 dollars for a case of soda
draining tax payers, eighty five thousand dollar oil filters
but won't pay they soldiers, halle burton workers make
fourteen thousand dollars a month, privates earn thirteen g's a year
please who 25 extra, taking fire in combat
recruit all the niggaz, that die from where i'm at
18 years old, talking 'kill, where saddam at? '
but can't have a gat, to protect where my moms at
i love to crunk, so what, plus i'm gangsta enough
to piss in pimping cans, pimp cup, rack again and pump it up
how bitches still get fucked, niggaz just want a forty and a blunt

yo, these youngsters they grow up on the block
with the product in they socks, and the fully loaded glocks
too many die in vein, and it's a crying shame
the murders and the hustles, won't stop as they shoot for the top
acquiring apparel, through growth and development
on they most dangerous missions, excuses were irrelevant
the brutality of war, never changes
and the out of control desire to win, makes it dangerous
fire engulfed the set, they feel the threat, greater than
what they ever had, experienced yet
indictments, sparked excitement, and the thrill to kill
suddenly they felt the need for a challenge in they field
the great boundaries of both man and machine
can have one at the point, to murder all in between
yellow tape scene, dead teen, the mob was his idol
giving a grim new meaning to the neighborhood's title, what's up?
yeah, heh.. mothafucka!

come to the dirt dog as the tummy rise

yo yo my wu-tang cliff'll make your atom split
the power of my brain, you can't fathom it
whoever go against the will of the grain will get slain
don't ever say thy god name in vain
my third eye electronic dragonfly spiral observe
can record your words 
and your lies and approach you
and have my dogs come and ghost you
when it comes to the bread son, the heat will toast you

music makes me lose control

copied on papers of scholars that earn dollars
we trendsetters in wu leathers, trendsetters in wu leathers, whatever

music makes me lose control
this is not just rock and roll
hip hop digs right to the soul
music makes me lose control
wu-tang, now we on a roll
on a rise, now here we go 

guaranteed to rip the show
rza beats is outta control

now here we go
ain't no shook in 'em, pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em
little niggaz hugging the block, cops is booking 'em
women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em
back when little j got shot, pops was whooping 'em
little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
the ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
get cash, get that ass, or put a foot in 'em
iron flag, flag that cab, bedford and put-e-nam

i'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem
it took a little time to get his juices going
producers know him, as the kid with the iron palm
righteous hammer, examine the firearm
approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar
empire strikes back, check out the death star
bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
where i'm from, we use dum-dums in the arsenal
highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
known to scuffle, i take it to the upper deck
universal conquest, kung fu, buckle vets
in a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs
give 'em ear hustle, wu brand, we programmed
next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam
i fear no man, son, you get lynched up
nigga bitch, get frankenstein stitched up


yeah, voice skipping off percussion
give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
all praise, the daunting, calm yet
so alarming, without a word being spoken
a thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
the contract was took, straight cash, off the books
a major pawn took a don, look, he's armed
with a few black rooks from the heart of the crook
shook ones look while they hung him on hercules hooks
they found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
the flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
yet heavier than weight, when my mindstate starts to break, take cover
over rza instrumental, i'm damn near invincible, it's simple


tell me, what are they like?
they got holes in the top, five round holes
while i was watching, this stranger, hit them
but his fingers went right through the bone
so then, they've... mastered it
it's some style of kung fu, you know it?
the skeleton claw
she's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) she's my number one starter chick
she's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit
i only wanna see it (my starter) it's truly needed, when the ball drops...
anything she say, you know i'm gonna do (my starter)
watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...

all-star shine so bright
hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights
you're my number one draft pick, madonna classic
no look dunks to the basket
yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...


blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke
i'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips
and round butt, catch heat when i'm in too deep
the answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets
whatever situation or the circumstances
outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
hotel, motel or holiday inn
overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
while the ceiling fan blowing her dress
ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
her skirt hid her talent until i raised the curtains
showtime at the apollo, she'll follow my lead
then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
strapped and ready to ride


yeah, that's my down bitch
that's my down bitch, anything she do for her man
if it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan
she a queen like liz the third, wicked curves
on her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
while she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
flat blew a nigga back, act two, i'm into that
damn right, she the star of my team
when we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
whether brooklyn, bronx, manhattan or queens
staten island, she styling, if not, she's not seen
playboy status, every man's lust
she acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs

i'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor
the floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?
let ya glass pour, wu-tang is here now
all my independent women, time to let ya hair down
bottles popping, everything is fair ground
fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
you'se a starter cuz i chose ya first
baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
yeah, i'm cold blooded, then ya love my style
this is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off
it's like clockwork, first to get ya work off
i'm the workhorse, killa bee performer
pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?


you've learned how to kill
every moved you've learned is trained to that end
yet, we wish to preserve life
the first thing to learn, is that difference
then you can start training with us, from the beginning
looking on various street corners
i'm sure you've seen it yourself
standing on the corner, is an alleged brother
dressed in blue or green, red and black
and, spouting the news, that the revolution is coming
and you better get ready, sort of like
the end of the world is coming, unfortunately
the world is just gonna get dragged on and on
and, we have a poem that we've written particularly
for the brothers on the street corners

yo, standing on porches in front of houses and corner stores
i'm born to more, horrific than syphilis, cuz where we live is
hell on earth, where was heaven when shit's real
we sold dope to get mill, for white folks in smith field
fuck israel, it's kill hills, spilt pills for my bill
write wills for my seeds, to live from, who take some
who give some, for brothers that was lynched hung, the symptoms
never go away, a stir away from colder ways
having ramblings and savages, blessed, from us asking
this whole cross, is more rust in florida oranges and lost orphans
i offer thought for food in full courses
i've soared into the night glow, my hat's low, my roots grow
for you to soon know, i reap what you sow

we just land down from liberia, young black man
in control of the pillars, millions buried in dirt
how many railroads do you own? how much clean chrome you own
this for my ancestors names engraved in stone
on the roads where the rebels once roamed
we built homes, civilized our own
king solomon childs, beautiful as black, this time
we will walk on water, this time
we will see through the lies, this time
prepare troops to move in, expand the runways
build bigger bridges, nine millimeters from brady
we living in war, so prepare for submission
apache helicopters, a black man's face on a dollar
the pigs constantly watch us, the streets is obnoxious
baby of the first nine, homey, in toxic

the first seed of a dope fiend, she a.d.d
needle parked off spring boughed, by she, wanna be
while her siblings is rich living, she ain't bitching
mama's working two jobs, try'nna maintain a living
few years passed, now she's getting raised by the streets
side by side, watchin' hustles, now she blazed like the streets
this is for my women living in the struggle
getting brought into this world without asking for the troubles
of the every day life-life, a battered wife
a single mother's holding it down, while the world so trife
crack fiend, you could of been something better in life
now hold your head up, ma, you know it ain't over, right?
yeah, this is for my russians on the grind
off the boat struggling try'nna hold a nine to five
yeah, i seen enough with these eyes
i thank the most high, i'm still alive
the only girl that could ever please me
was the daughter of a preacher man

yo, pa, i got a lady, i'm 'bout to make her my baby
might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
she know my style wavy, i'm circlin' her mercedes
father, father was a preacher, i'm almost certain he hates me
but he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
and she decides on her own who resides on the throne
i'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
and she understands the fact that i'm even right when i'm wrong
when she was prayin' in church, i was playin' in dirt
that's 100, i admit that we both was playin' at first
when opposites attract, i ain't always sayin' it works
i'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
it's wu-tang, baby, my crew bang
and she's the preacher's daughter, i just call her my boo thang
and we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
man, sometimes i tell your parents just don't understand

no. yo, you mean pastor brown's daughter?
the preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
i used to see her sundays comin' from church
we used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
yo, her parents didn't play
she couldn't even come out to play on a school day
thought she was gonna give me some on april fool's day
(but no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)

the preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
she know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
she married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
see her in the market place loud and boisterous
with tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
she a seductress in the form of a goddess
never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
man, that's how she molest you
that's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
never sin around righteous people
black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you


i met her on the bus stop with black eyes
that's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
i cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
so she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
never knew the science of virtue, ecclesiastes
like, a time for peace, a time for war
a time to laugh though, she never felt god before
eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
between me and her, it don't concern you

aiyyo i roll like a bat out of hell
evil acapell's fly spittin out of my grill
before i hit the sky with springtime colors
juicy as a sunkist, certain broads double dutch this
they carve it in they wrist, pales berry blazes
straighten the crumbs left on the stove, clothes in my lady hair
plus yours the look gold god, the old tainted bald technique
got these vestibules designer niggaz in they whips
jumpin out they seats, eighteen, bronzeman part ii
we like dorothy hamill on ice
we in your hood we might circle, hats down low in the range
switch lanes, change my tire, peel out
real loud on the stage yo, i shitted on your hood kid
i shitted on your hood, got to your burner too late
i'm lookin real good, draped out
shinin like a fresh fifty cent piece, your girlfriend, c'mere
oh shit, you my man's niece, the gourmet pocket twenty
bombs made of clay, sexcapades take place
we fucked in forty-eight shades might walk up in your studio
time slap your engineer, it's lighter fluid to that style
hand me the matches now


aiyyo rainbow roley on the wrist, now what's this
niggaz bless this, eight and a half, bally banana twist
e shakes, puffin on lye, feedin the seed's plate
pullin out, old dirty eights to rob gates
major wake up, the kid telltales, make a nigga head wake up
beats break, the nigga would take off his time
honolulu status, gladdest
the rich rock cabbage and dollar vans grands
that nigga mad savage, stationary hall of justice
niggaz came clumped out
just came home, now they bunked out
money be longer than triple life
til the sun burn out, that's my word
move it with the burner out
fidel way of thinkin, roll with the mac bent ac-10
most of my team, five percent check what the live said
rollin with guess vests pedestrians yo
holdin my nuts, fuckin thousand dollar lesbians



let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
witness, forget his, original statement
even in protection programs there's no escapement
gunned down, we in town, hit king from seven crowns
spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the zebra lounge
wounded, back in the eighty-three summer heat
up in three-oh-nine park, rhymin off the drummer's beat
i stalk the city streets demonstratin mic wrecks
all lookin stank, i ain't playin wit a full deck
and as they nervously stare, i know they scared
they saw the coming of wu, the neon in times square
household name, assassin, killa bee
mill to the grain, that posess the wu, trilogy
quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
those that got styles, they got identical twins
don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finnicky
without skills, they master the art of mimicry
but i go line for line on the whole page
your unspotted life on the mic is old age

ladies and gentlemen: sunz of man
uhh, jungle of concrete
yo, yo

in the jungle, we gotta rumble with the bees/wee
ain't nothin sweet, we gotta eat

yo, we come from starvin days, runnin up in dr. j's
rock away, so the mega trades, diggin, pockin days
yo, the aids wasn't in, calm braids all trimmed
army suits snatched and timbs
you'se a friend, snatch a gem

i spent a lifetime of doin crime, hustlin dimes, guzzlin wine
smugglin wives, one of a kind
under the sunshine, movin as one mind, the genuine
star child, allah's style, many say their barber's wild
when i element the foul, prowl, upon the weekend of sweet
i gotta eat, generate with the heat, demolish beats
collectin sheets, war with beast, islamic warrior
livin the mass hysteria, the bomb shell of america
swell competors, explicit lyrics from the editor
realistic predator, the rhyme writer, climb heights
rhymes ignite, mc's reputation, blown out of sight
on the mic device, my crew get nice, shoot dice
doin callistetics, young diplomatics with automatics
the asiatic, fuck a fanatic, i split his attic
you don't want no static, i make you carriage for the rabbits


we've got to take what we want, let these others rappers front
yo, take that, you ain't goin get it laid back
best record what i say, ain't no time to playback
that's right platinum hits, yo, before the age at
gather millions, acapella in the streets, today crack
fuck opinions, i'm hittin to the nights endin
a new beginin, takin over men and women
thoughts used for sinnin, neighborhood no grinin
thug religions, expeditions, startin for a mil
stick the student for his intuition
beyond college, street knowledge, got to eat knowledge
off the tree of life, while seek wallets
credit cards, some trust for their gods
in the wizard of oz, you get it all to get robbed
price is on the food and the earth's precious jewels
ain't the golden rules from the golden black jewels
steppin out the furnace, only run with fast learners
burn cash and we stash burners
we be the underground childs, mainstream now
sort of like apocalypse, bloaw, blaow
take what you own, must return to your home
claim back your throne, we're on a higher zone
black lazurus, plus we're not havin it
pass the diamonds on the wrist, we're on some take the earth shit
demolish every tool, that y'all niggaz work with
the barcode, bio chips be short circuited

here in this jungle, jungle, jungle ?
i'm livin through, your crew on the subject
the loot, i'm new improved
plus my time piece is bullet proof
i need a bulldozer or crane, that stains like in vain
you be the blood and i be the drainin on
forgot to burn your proper on, with the tool stone
written, founded dead on this spot
you emergin, believe i'm the surgeon
rhymes leave your brain on all right, double scenes
back hand, slap you, clap thoughts, like evil raps
play that, what it slap right back
you was seen, soak the zeen
self esteem, so common, even suckers die
major league, total assassinator, rhyme complicator
the devil and the sword bring death, feed jamaica
rain or hurricane, step on my house
into the house on severe pain, strong like a pyramid
nothin but various parts of the house that jack built
the little house on the praire, i huff and i puff
and i blow your brain to a seisure
before you step to me, you should of called off
ceaser's father, mercy words, i'm no joke
i cancer smoke, i reply, "your brain and told"
i live for my tech 9, uzi, grenade, all cause of one rhyme
better believe, sleeves, i buck you chicken
make you love us, my mic around your neck to bug it


"i have taught you well, everything i know
you have even surpassed my skill
but why is it so important?!
years ago, your father was a royal guard
the best that there was
he won many royal merits
but still, during a special contest
he was beaten by five {?} experts
he was disgraced, and so was our clan..."

"it was long ago, but he has never forgotten that day though
and you are his only hope, to redeem the clan
and retrieve our honor..."

for many though, this birth place
of the automobile and organized labor
was seen as a promised land
for 25 years, sudden black migrated north
seeking middle class prosperity
but by summer of 1967
much of that hope, had turned to hopelessness

yo, you that wrong, i crack a sky, a black dawn
put your wallabies back on, it's time for a swarm
you that wrong, you get your timberlands blacked on
jungle fatigues, bulletproof vests back on

i blow dimes all up in your way, spit a dart in your face
you don't know me in the first place
my birthday equivalent to forty earthquakes
i smirk gray, polly on streets where the motors leaks
kids hold heat cause they plates is gold
my weight's in goal, turn about face behold
the street scroll, never once flow, said wise old
elder, i hear beats like helen keller
feel 'em straight out the speaker, to my animated blood flow
pass records around like contaminated needle, heave hoe
my sound heavy like tree fall, i flee halls, bleed through gauds
carry grym reaper in millimeter form, you spill a liter for him
born to take any soul, relentless henny flow, chops heads like guillotines
smoke philly's with my queen, i'm still in the machine
dt's at my day job, talking bout the date room
they may drown me, my shadow too vicious
can't keep them around me, hide 'em under the hoody
he live like whitney, intelligent like eli
we ride like the genie, pass time
like a clock used for a frisbee, george roll
wallstreet, that's the shoes that fit me


burn a building, wu-tang bats all in the sky
causing a black day, i see through the eye
of a tornado, false feed with greater labels
tower of babel labels, follow room when i call the chrome
tell home lord, i slice you, i engineer
trains of thought, diabolical molecules
light skin marksmen, part taming your follicles
twelve men equipped, seven rappers can vouch too
about you, fuckin' with me, my clan emblem
remember where it came from, four eye, cock and name one
dart at the cranium, fuck up your suit coat
each rhymes i wrote, aimed at the ivory coast
piano keys i tap, like a nervous child's knee
i served in the streets for the army of god
bring your bomb squad, national guard, i'm passin' through bars
escapin' prison, armed with great vision
god given heredity, better be
the armed bank robber with pedigree


"think differently!"

they know they time up, guess that's why they hate me so
but yo, they will never take me though, i had to go like
montana, licking, sniffing crazy blow

at the same time, marvel the speed
i'm so dope, i can bottle it free
the most influential, modern day murderous he

yo, deep in the bungalo, chopping the motherload
carving my own path, taking another road
i need a son to soul, he brought the troops with him
it sounds presidential, i got the truth serum
don't want the booth near him, respect in the sabotage
i'm on the patio, stretched in my camouflage
and my grammar's hard, the wolverine skeleton
i be the yellow man, snatching on the other brand
but on the other hand, light up the darkness
i'm stir fried, nigga, yeah, i'm heartless
my apartment is a hole in the wall, nigga

and that weighs on me heavy like rasputia
but i still keep spitting like a shortshop

you gon' be sitting at the table with a porkchop
lacking on the beat like a short cop
it's your boy ace, bk's own
all you ringtone rap dudes, please stay home, come on
brother, i think that necklace is causing you too much trouble

my necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
the guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
the charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
chain glowing shining and i'm ready for beef
like my nigga 2 chainz, cappuccino from the east
from the wu-tang clan, my necklace and my heat
bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
universal flag on, nigga, i got shine


i keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
iced out cubans, exotic stones from africa
this the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the god's loco
jury truckin' fancy spend stacks upon delancey
exhaust pipes coffin horse kicks
acp's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
my links is unbreakable, told y'all on the purple tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, i'm wealthy


why you say that?
it's real, kill a nigga for this shit
aha, yo relax sis

dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
eric b on the cut when it blings
scrubbin' chain down in colgate, double edged bangers
on they hips i wait in the jaw break
the snakes and the violators, dracula style takers
we got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the lakers
hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
and i ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
that's what you get when you throwin' on cuban's
drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a ruger
crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
you might as well do me now cause i will do ya


god-cipher-love-divine in math 79
bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
still the same when exposed to air and water
like when amongst thieves you travellin' across the border
the brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
the message was lost in transmission
that's often in a free elemental form
nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
malleable ductile metal on many levels
get you shot for a flintstone, killed for a pebble
lieutenants and generals move with criminals
the pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
the scope is on the rope, claws on the table
brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
and it's sold by the weight
shaped into a plate with food on it
the hungry wolves lie and wait


tu tin-to. so you're the tigers of tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. i'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. i'll show you the three different strokes. forest tiger! win tiger, winmau tiger!
wake up... wake up
wake up...

wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
the motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
my peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
screaming jesus can save us, i, i get the bentley if i save up
but that's just another trick to enslave us
push the minimum wages
put, put our fathers up in them cages
then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
but, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
that doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
from my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
from my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in

allah said to save the babies from the cold
pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
without action now who can disagree with me?
god is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
that you could show and prove to me
but still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
i'm g-o-d, to infinity, for real

the world won't get no better
if we just let it be
the world won't get no better
we gotta change it yeah, just you and me

poor reparations, the bush administration
unequality, martial law, segregation
false hood, false teaching, false education
now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
they deceiving us, they don't believe in us
they believe in that cream like julius caesar
i'm like marcus garvey, malcolm x with the heaters
ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
never worship the image if we were swine eaters
i'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
we in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
i'm god-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
that i recite with song
trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
for all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
black fist, staten island, stand up, stand strong
penetrate through the gate and bring the clan along


wake up and realise the times
that we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
but it was a dream like martin luther
he had a vision that could move a mountain
protect one another, that's world to my brother malcolm
as-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
we want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
and then they shoot us down like wild animals
the nerve of them cold-hearted killers
with blue suits slaying our black youth
the earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
we need a solution fast, get inshallah bill
let me educate them, translate it meaning god's will
it goes all in together, together how we are
to stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
and that's the willie lynch tactics that separated the masses
taught us all to think backwards



the technique is ill son, watch how i spill one
peace to biggie, 2pac, big l and big pun
havoc on the streets of staten, snitches
house niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern
somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
for those that murdered me shall stand before god
to fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

what the fuck is going on, i can't go to sleep
feds jumping out their jeeps, i can't go to sleep

look at who you are, you've come too far
it's in your hands, just be a man
get the jelly out your spine
cobwebs out of your mind

i can't go to sleep, i can't shut my eyes
they shot the father at his mom's building seven times
they shot malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
jesse watched as they shot king on the balcony
exported marcus garvey cause he tried to spark us
with the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
oh jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
america's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
what's the science? somebody? this is trick knowledge
they try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
walking through park hill, drunk as a fuck
looking around like these devils
i'm ready to break this world down
they got me trapped up in a metal gate
just stressed out with hate
and just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate

heart colder than winter fresh, chest smokin like incense
vets broken into the flesh, soakin in ya own mess
chrome bleds, some of the known best soldier vets
over cassette, you get smashed like crashed desert air shows
holdin ya breath, gaggin for a bit of oxygen
submission put a stop to men, reveal the foul document
lockin position, invision, adapt critical condition
pitiful you didn't listen, now we're spiritual blessin
viewer discretion advised, sabotage satellites
splatter guys, get ya food ate like i'm big mac and fries
trap nines in the thighs, symbolize real lives
instill a rocket fuck from the inside to the outside
in ya mouth lied the barrel, subdue bone marrow
ya tone shadow, blown from high-explosive poem battles
dome smack, you live, projectiles effectin you
incredible new wave heart, blade sharp verses sexin you
claim professional, but i never met you
son i never forget you
i slaughter foes when my particles wet you
to the rescue

professional vets, now comin through vexed
i'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?
the s on your chest, better stand for super-stress
the golden arms pressed, next, here to set you
rec! i suggest niggas come to the rescue

slash hope, raw burnin, freezin thoughts are cold
ballistic missle lift off, now one behold
my throat harden for harlem, harness the volume
with grief fallin on me in a breeze, the seas partin
it's two men awesome, uncanny
the handy man crook, the rap gank where every damn nook and cranny
plus four more opponents couldn't throw me, couldn't slam me
i told you before, this is war, it's radical claw
menate the the law, practice my ambition
understand determination, plus my burnin condition
rebuild 'em, sing a song strong for disaster
scorch 'em on a letter, clever, bled 'em much faster
exotic lens, bionic timb's, hardco' organic
the floor panic when revolvin, shaolin dodgin
potion of my juice, it's "houston we have a problem"
its basic instinct, motor mouth, hold is sacred
the rushmore rock face, one four shot with the greatness
raw shoulders, sword colder, no remorse
the crash course, the portions of my porsche
divorse it, the holocaust exhaust, driven with force
mighty ship back on course, i almost lost it
toss the smokin corpse, seldom sing
shells amongst men, rebellion, teens formin and swarmin
vikin style, strikin without warnin a nation
standin ovation, rap devastation
new animation, the scandal
bandle the best part, damsel in distress, i'll bless you
god damn you! to the rescue

professional vets, now comin through vexed
i'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?
the s on your chest, better stand for super-stress
the golden arms pressed, next, here to set you
rec! i suggest niggas come to the rescue
en garde, i'll let you try my wu-tang style

"iron man," i cock my music in the chamber

lay back at the palace like mike harris
callous, fly nicest, metallic bang mallets
fly your whole carriage to paris
the black pat garrett, karats on donna karans
guys die tryin to drive the mclaren
islamic, burn chronic out on the terrace
angelic, your body lie cold without spirit
my finest hour, you're sacrificed to a higher power
fly from the tower, i fry sour
and buy powder, 40 cal give your pal a shower
you shit in your calvin klein trousers
the night prowler, your life is ours
knife your eddie bauer, leave you pushin up flowers

dependin on my mental state, the mood that i'm in'll make
me charge like a bull, pull the tool out and ventilate you
sin-ner takes you down, lace your crown, face get found
full of rounds from the pound, that detonate when they penetrate
can tell you always been a snake, you don't move like i do
imitators hate the fact that they can't do what i do
i'm mindful of my rivals, i can smell 'em when they slide through
provide you my arrival, still won't even get a side view
won't know that life is over, 'til i'm standin right beside you
it's not that i don't like you motherfuckers, i despise you
the other different pedigree, not cut from the same cloth
stay g'd up from the feet up, while your heart pump duck sauce
i love it when they tough talk, my guns lust to bust off
but every time i squeeze they call police to bus me up north
sin-ister the finisher, they label me a menace and got
mad when i laughed at the judge durin sentencing
not, glorifyin prison but i'm built tough for biddin
see survival of the fittest shit i live it e'ry minute
every hour to the second, i'm granted my respect

three hundred, push-ups a day, put the crease on your back
be the captain and lieutenant, black man, who invented
chopping samples up, to make the beats that's ascended to
every genre of music, the whole sphere of music
i produce the range, engineer the music

my ear candy been dope, my pen stroke like zorro
hit the heavy bag, like foreman in the congo
mini transmitter, night vision in the stronghold
rock long robes, smell snakes with a strong nose
every time the horn blows, the wu's signal's back on
transform, pack form a whole another platform
we coming back for him, to smash the spot
kid, i'm on your team to, pass me the rock
til the casket drop, i'mma flip your wig
rip clothes, honey didn't know my dick this big
you get kicked in the ribs, with two chrome gauge
deadly venom, i send 'em, back to stone age
as we return, to the 36 chambers
the rza, the gza
the ol dirty bza
u-god, chef, the ghostface killah
and meth, rebel i soldier for the foreclosure
don't forget about the masta, yo

motherfuckers halt, when my colt, start stompin
thunder, strikes your land with a jolt
your stamina level is low, like currents from
the volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
at a speed that the naked eye can't die-tect
the infantry, peep the weapon-try as i bomb atomically
stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
by this total square mileage of violence that i brung
i've not yet begun to stung
it's the ethics, the rigorous training methods
of the abbott, incite overseas to opposition
penetrates then infiltrates
breakin down your resistance
leavin competition defenseless, masta
hip-hop antagonizer, dumb deaf and blind civilizer
with the silencer

psssh, yo
pile-driver tut boulder face blow hulk
anger rap book causin chess blade smoke
minds the trunk, punk, elephant gun poke
jaw-breaker humanoid vice-grip, choke
face the inferno, maestro, pull it
pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
never, sold my soul golden arm cold stinger
see me on the streets address me stone bringer
ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in
sweet action packed rap
bite it, stomp on a beat
posess hollow head battle teeth tony atlas
wu status, now, wisdom to the masses

cock back my tongue like a hammer, my head is like
a nickel-plated bammer, spit forty-five caliber grammar
at the speed of wind makes you bleed within
crack your skull, without penetratin your skin
reign of champ official, wu scamp with black pistols
spent the weekend programmin fat tracks at camp cristal

home on the range, rebel with a pen
writin critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
mista, meth, hot nickels
say my shit holding my sex pistol, deal me in

the bewilderin killa bee quickly sting ya
i ain't gotta life one fuckin finga
make sure to god i reef turns on the ringer
we duckin the subpeona
fatal flying guillotine machine from medina

shots from shaolin that go to masapeaqua

ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
recognize the gods came, for one accord
for one mind and one cause, that's the shit son
play them crows out position
you might hear me but you don't listen
competition come and get some on
red marker still bleedin, through the paper
of his sick premeditated, murder caper

plush the canola range spittin off the roof, holdin my change
yo it's ragtime, universal 12 monkey mind

the undervolt staten new york
it's the burner shaolin bound facedown you gets murdered
roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through midair
landin thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
keeps the iron, where the head rest, for the conquest
subway, wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
matched up in a staircase, in a dark place embraced
by the trey-eight, i'm in so deep i can't escape
these crime situations, i stay in man formation
and shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
p.l.o., slam cats like bam bam, bigolo
throw a flow like nomo relate like fidel castro
i be the great all pro, hangin mc's by they logos
my street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno
"you will be punished (wu-tang style)
for all your evil deeds. (wu-tang style)
be warned - you will suffer.. (wu-tang style)
.. justice!" (wu-tang style)

slept on this hazardous enterprise
hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
week self-captivity became months
those who were holdin it down they hold a pump
do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
got a mass of starvin niggaz wanna eat supper
unfair corruptions lead to abductions
creatin wider circles of destructions
so we attack, with the pen and blaze in
from the terrifyin to the fascinating
quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
they heavily defended airfields
but they bodies rot behind punctured steels
when i greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
oh that water was my liquid of choice
forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
powerful projection, noise is deafening
carrier battle groups, that's threatening
higher level bombing, plus
the shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
in the same crucial manner but different style

(wu-tang style, wu-tang style!)

yeah..
aiyyo once again, all blunts again
yo the real remain silent, any type of violence i'm in
allah's helpful most, innovative raps
that brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
we holdin, automatic semis with sick lines
run up, body niggaz, break down shoddy niggaz
styles so sharp, state of the art
greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin darts
flowin like water, "apocalypse now"
gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
runnin through parkin lots, don't get caught
let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks

it ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin in the hood
gotta a hundred wolves waitin in the woods
for the clan's forthcomin
i miss you in the game a court summons
and fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
e'rything was wack 'til we popped up
and got it on and poppin like orville reddenbacher
potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
wu-tang got ya, like every ghetto got a tasha
request lines are now open, you see these mc's chokin
and thinkin, "what's that shit they be smokin?"
i'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
keep my shit funky when i spit this braggadocious
to critic what i write, that's my muh'fuckin word
blah blah blah, like n'sync
kiss that ass "bye bye bye" knahmsayin?  i ain't playin

many shall come, few chose to stay exact
track after track i'm fightin for survival
before me i see hills and mountains they sway
the words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
i walk water holdin y'all suspended with the vocal
what's the total people that came to see the gods?
i gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
potentcy, high-level content
side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
all ages streets to cages, split faces
shoutin nuff love to the peeps from miami
we live from pulaski and spread glassy

oh yeah, comin through with my shaolin crew
two cent for a case, gimme st. ide's brew
in the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
methtical's in a jam on how dry i am

... with st. ides in my system
crack another i'm blitzed, let's go hit the next one
hang it over, the object is to stay sober
lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur

who's the wallabee kid, stressed out, could never be son
ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
that blow between the bushes, st. ide's and i the king of teams

crack the bottle of the st. ide's, sippin to those
who don't realize that drinkin ain't only to be drunk
you can't drive, keep my peoples alive
and if the saint don't know you from a can of paint

it was hot, on the spot, so i jetted at the block
and i asked for st. ide's, i could tell by the dot
on the back he rebuilt it... not that charcoal filtered
ice cold bottle tilted... to my cup he spilt it
aaaaaaaaaah!!! st. ides! mmmmmmmmmmm...

to all my niggaz across the world
raise your motherfucking fist in the air
and get ready for the triumph
cause the gods is here to take over this shit
word up, peace
born with the struggle, used to hustle for crumbs
fillin blunts in the building front thuggin for ones
full clips, fly dicks, down somethin to pump
whole cliques fly whips, dimes nothin to son
city boy on the corner, i was so involved
so the drama i embraced it with open arms
was tryin to shake the pain, hopin i could break the chains
every day the same, who am i to make a change?
will my niggaz risk it all just to play the game?
and the young'uns goin through it tryin to play the same
through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire
sent to your son, forgive me for the sins that i've done

my life, my pain lasts forever
nothin in these streets makes it better
my life, my pain lasts forever
nothin in these streets makes it better
and so i live on

sittin here thinkin drinkin got a, lot on my mind
is my, life shrinkin am i, caught in the times
it's a, quarter to nine and i'm, grabbin my 9
i had dreams i just, wanted to rhyme
climb my ways out these whack-ass ghettos
i signed my name on the line with the devil
still in my prime weight but lost minds are settled
pots on the stove, move grandma's kettle
late for my job, he thinks he's a star
she hates her husband, she says i'm a slob
mixed feelins she ain't gettin involved
battle of the sexes, the planet's off its axis
the irs god damn i owe these taxes
the truth hurts, but i can take it
it's a long time comin, but i can make it
no mistakin, the cream is back


i'm standin on my own two
i got my niggaz, true niggaz, real niggaz!
stop the wheel really? you only feel me
if you walk the same road, talk the same code
still dwellin in the hell and find the time to make a home

for his wickedness, politics is the trickiest
business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest
snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider
who's pulling these strings, from napoleon to hitler?
is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?
the unclean man from the unclean land
desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest
give his life in this world that seem so lifeless
put a price on things, that are priceless
convince us that meanness is stronger than the niceness
who really has the power - is is theirs, is it ours?
is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?
do we have a press or president?
is it a test or a testament? pest or pestilence?
who got the evidence?
who got the common sense? stop all the negligence


i oversee the world

the law hating, warring like blacks and caucasians
god versus satan, i'm laying in the dark
with the mossberg, waiting, letting off first basing
slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
this flow, call it oj blood on the glove
above rap, capital g's speak on the facts
please believe that, meaning that i keep it a stack
he's back, he a beast on the track
the only time that i go soft is probably with your freak in the sack
feel the bass make sure he shake, murder verse, first forty-eight
manslaughter, nearly caught a case
i crack heads more than base
stack bread when i orchestrate, that said y'all the base


i seen niggas sniff coke through a crazy straw
come out they shirts sweating bullets with the bobby brown jaw
dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a newport
we all holdin' the torch

first time i finally got with wu, nobody really even knew what they looked like with the exception of, you know, that music video that i think they made for $10 for-for method man. but the problem was the business of wu-tang. they missed the photoshoot. the only photos they had, that i guess, featured them in masks. at the time, you know, this is pre-internet. if you missed the photoshoot, there was no way for a magazine to course correct. the magazine came out but instead of these photos, everybody had a basic, not even like an illustration, but a caricature. raekwon the chef, there was an illustration of raekwon wearing like a chef hat. ol' dirty bastard is pictured with a blow up doll. i didn't like 'em but the thing was-was i completely understood the position that they were put in. without art we would have to kill the story. i didn't think the illustrations reflected the seriousness of what i witnessed. cause musically wu-tang was just off the charts. i thought it looked corny. some stories turn out great and some stories don't turn out great. this was the one i felt was only okay and um you move on. it came out and nothing happened. i didn't hear anything from the group
first person that i see, masta killa walks up, i didn't know him at the time. and he say "yo, is you cheo?" and i said "yeah." bam, i get hit in the face. he's right 'cross my left eye. "that's just to let you know wu-tang clan nothing to fuck with. we come real with our shit. we ain't no fuckin' cartoon characters."

like jiggaman, nigga, if you hear me, fuckin' holla
power rings like the green lantern, last seen in a mean phantom
in the valley of ohio, outside the town of canton
or the grotty body projects in the killa hills of staten
saw a redbone in my shower just looking like paula patton

the pressure was on, tippy tippy, i'm on my toes
fuck risin' to the occasion, the temperature been rose
set it off like intros, blast you and your kin folks
a trouble maker, bitcher taker, a scorpio
naughty by nature, my unit brings the flavor
we cake up like make up, and in new york
fuck the daily news, shyheim, i made the paper
want a anchor and a lock, drop-top, three-and-a-quarter
my mother in hell said, "people in hell want ice water"
it'll be a manslaughter, private-eye, that's an order

cuz everythin' the pastor said was fake and it hurt

"in trouble"
that's my word
niggas don't be there for real

word bond, all you get is a five-- five minute
conversation

i could flip that and bring back a brick in coke
never took a short, never took a snort
caught a warrant in new york for not appearin' in court
but i'll stilll survive, some of my closest homies died
murdered in homicides, i just couldn't let it slide
fuck money, jury and bein' a rap star
i hoped out shootin', soon as my bitch stopped the car
plus shyheim with the scar did it
that's what everyone said on my trial menace
they thought i was finished, but then i got acquitted
and pied niggas in their eye for the fuckin' spinach
not for olive oyl

"and you need some love and care"
"when you're down, in trouble"
"and you need some love and care"
"the wu-tang clan will rise again
there are many of us, working for the good of the wu tang"



so get your egg crashed, by my hellz wind staff
while the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
like kaity chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
his father watched the horror as he swallowed his tongue
another youth dead, before the age of twenty-one
left his son to grow, in the ghettos of the slums
with a shot that go, for twisted metal for cash flow
react slow nigga and get, p.l.o.
by the lone gunner, who took revenge for his brother
who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
a new year is dawning, new crews is forming
rival gangs warring blood steadily pouring
the streets are deep son every day is like a rerun
so i reach out and try to teach one
but eighty-five percent uncivilized content
no tolerance so a lifetime is spent
behind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench
killer instinct slave rap niggaz get lynched



so yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
tell ra, goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
to all you slow footed penguins, ducking from these
hot rocks that's flaming, chocolate for all you rap damian's
spraying cards espionage, dodgeball square hard
strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
and a mink in, next album 'blood on chef's apron'
keep a gambino playstation in your playpen
discovery channel, cats that book at daniel
coke blunts hot as a fuck swatted bamboo
high school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out
on the regular for robbin a good nigga house
rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
hot rock lava, gringo throw the flows iglasa



ha ha ha ha, yo
what you know about this, specialist armed dangerous
hit you close range with this madness
unique design shine like a deep dish
the beat kick technique split all your weak shit
yes, the rhythm, the rebel
alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
living legend, veteran known to set trend
lethal weapon, step through your section
with the force like luke skywalker
rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
live performer, bit the mic sayanora
borderline to insane, i rain firewater
tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
i got my sword cross your throat you joke


we on the run with the golden guns, get you none
when it reach out and teach someone, blaze they buns
now i'm guilty by association
times of blackness eclipsing the sun, target practice
commence when i throw these darts at these rappers
ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your mattress
hold me down, wu bloodkin, i'm going in
shootin bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
blend like a chameleon
all these niggaz want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
we can go platinum but then, still can't get no satisfaction
once again, back on the block crumb snatching
blowing backs in cold
blunted non-assassin, time for action, johnny unidas
handle that like arthritis
still, hold a golden touch like king midas



drownin' problems in heinekens imported from holland
gettin boosted off a killer bee pollen,
stone columns get cracked by drum tracks
smack loud as gun loud as gun claps
pin a crab to death with a thousand thumb tacs
the wu sensai fold, it beez the wind ninja scroll
sole edged blade controls your inner pole
the fig loot, fruit from the forbidden tree root
i stay secluded in the chamber training new recruits
with fatal guillotine, the black hooded team what it means
when bullets scream from the hot glock like rock from a sling
("sometimes...") pushed through like george bush operation whoops
shots get popped on the block causing blood to gush.
from digital to analog, the wu-wear camouflage
the entourage squad we stomping through zanzibar
like herds of cattle, rza plays the wall like a shadow
connect the brook to shaol like the varrazano narrow.


stash the cream though, iceatollah ice style gleama
lex graffiti name reamer, hold em we rolling
asking me though, raps is hotter than, hot tamales in toledo
pussy that shit she passin off to me though
we wax ajax niggaz with a axe, maxamill
you could crash a meal, got you back steel
scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
sit back eyeing y'all niggaz out
fakes that delegate we spittin fire out
verb burglar, design the wally shoe store reserve
a jet status, guyanese all up on my mattress
watch me mack this, ralph lauren goose inside a fashion
yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
style enriched, resonate the waves with one change
feelin mics like, wheeling a bike, slide like
step on his klondike, get your dart right
we moving on it like, wind breaker niggaz get they face broke
jewelry get snatched, magazine right on the low, fuck ya'll gats!

("sometimes...")

"may you rot in hell!"
"ahahahahah, ahahahahaha, ahahahahaha!"

guns jammed up, i'm cramed up in my lab
six niggaz, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags
one toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic
and two niggaz hooked on pussy
and in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons
and learned how operate the smith and the wesson
still cut class and played hookey
threw freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies
rolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks
big forehead, had ears like spock
he was mightier than a truckload of gats
and bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat

while the we rumble with the foul and trife
shots fired on the block in threes like glen rice
made men think twice about the sacrifice

write it for my fam who not here who do care
glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
from the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
bass and drums, see my face in the slums
pedia brown, media surround my sound
when you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound
sample with black, criminal, mechanical rap
assemblin hat, laced in a suit from phat

i was like, "yo bitch - why ain't no food fixed?"
she on the phone with her friend talkin bout dick
i snatched the receiver from that bitch like click
she got all excited, tryin to throw fit
swung at me then i swung back - bitch!

what you in fo'?  it happened in the club
with some thugs i was at the bar, smokin bud, hollerin at love
ladybug was playin in my peachfuzz, she was
talkin hot fudge, can't nobody do it like she does
in the hot tub - didn't know her man was in the club
and honey dove never mentioned that she had a scrub
it must have been the drugs or the alcohol buzz, had me
shootin my game like a thirty-eight snub baby
let's cut a rug, that's when i felt a shove
what the blood do - actin like he won the golden gloves
i get one for holdin grudge, but if this kid throw a slug
i'ma throw a slug - that's how we be rollin cuz
i see this dud tryin to play me like a pair of lugz
big john stud, goldschlager in a golden mug
what you in fo'?


i'm locked down for tryin to hold my block down since a shorty
the old earth was like, "street put the glock down"
i was raised in slums, love how the gun sounds
and now i got one - c'mon, who wanna front now?
sunup to sundown, ready for showdown
whoever wanna throw down, the gangsters better slow down
wake up, before you be in a cell with forty of us
(what you in fo'?) in for murder over money love and lust
(what you in fo'?) in for life, don't let me tell you twice
i might bang you twice and take double the life
what you in fo'?

fuck the c.o.'s, aiyyo boo, i need clothes
slide brokers where phones get hid
fuck with russians and latins
the most powerful marble black slipper style
goin out thrashin niggaz, kicks get thrown
big sizes, sleep in your boots, 4000 rugged f troops
notarized wigs, lay six months
that's alright dog, make it home lord
heard you admit it in the box, slid it under walls
bang monster anger
bop through the halls with bangers
live god like the abbot of all chambers..

in the battle fields mics collide like sword fights
get stabbed up by the swift technique of a black knight
who pierce strikes like vicious snakes, rhymes elevate
niggaz get sniped watch me annihilate
the gods got me eating off a fine dinner plates
with this rap shit told me don't procrastinate
west coast lyricist, killa bee clique we swarm thick
spit the written like scripts
no but fully loaded throw darts and make it hit, the target
pardon, me as i keep on starting, mo' shit
feel the wrath with these raw hits from math
you don't stand a chance, you can't top it we too advance

sharp shooter with the greatest accuracy
blast it rapidly, if those attacking me are after me
you never capture me, it's sad to see niggaz testing me
you meet your destiny can't get next to me
the best of me you know the recipe
the cut-throat making blood soak from the gun-smoke
have you gasping for oxygen
then pops you with the glocks again
drop 'em in with the street life, the street type
we snipe, artificial niggaz under street lights
street fights transform into wars with firearms
bullets storm niggaz start to swarm like rise on
dying on the same blocks when they exchange rocks
and hand cops flamed rocks
year after year up in the same spot
total madness synergy in city streets
battle many fleets as they walk by the gates of the darkside

yo,yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

the microphone magnificent
burning hot like syphilis
hit your dish drink from distances
bombin' leave no witnesses
the street division kid from the,
home of the wasteland
styles bionic, sounds blow holes through your basement
face it for the black knights there's no replacement
you're basic, kid put this in your mouth so you can taste it
these ancient rhymes are lethal
when manifested bring wrath of bloody vengeance
to suckers that second guessed it
confess it i got the type flows that'll make you stagger
came out my mother's womb with a blunt and bloody dagger
from day one i knew that i'll be on some ol' lye shit
do or die shit, ready to ride slug slide shit

the audity prodigy,
the cosmos commodity, knowledge guides equality
a whiff while i myth and a sniff off a e&j fifth
and a spliff, the proton neutron,
sally with the crouton dipping in the yucon,
supernova yoga, dosia, ambrosia crane and cobra
the yolk for help and the stealth with the knowledge of self
like no one else, the code of yoba
from the noble none of my niggaz local

your kung fu is good, your magic is good
that is why he waited, so my power would dwindle
my power has dimished, then he come to kill me
yes, but, i know your kung fu is still very good
if you practice again, no one could possibly be your match
oh, the ancient weapon

yeah, fierce, i travel across seas on glaciers
four shoguns that got fucked by geishas
still gracious, still able to twist out darts
just grew tougher skin from swimming with them sharks
broken ankle, fucking with them wallabee clarks
got them bitches still screaming my name ("what up starks?")
i'm a bone crusher, ox'll split your face like a dutch master
no more minks, it's polar bears from alaska
with shark skin air maxes and igloos of ice
rocks clumped up, like overcooked rice
i'm nice, you're the reason why the game went soft
bland niggas, i come through and season your broth
like mr. dash, i blast, i'm a menace like dennis
young coles, and i'm back from a six month sentence
rehabilitated, back in the yard, flying heads with barbwires
stay tying niggas to beds

can you kill me?
if i didn't think so, i would not be here waiting for you now
right, let me see what you got
forget the tricks, let's see your kung fu

a golden boy to promote it right, sorta like a ill de la hoya fight
i'm eating good, enjoying life, flawless ice, quick to bag a baller's wife
with no strings attached, cordless mics
toilet white s5 fifty with the wrong pipes
peeling off like snake skin, watch the cobra bite
over night success story, go and check for me
you rap poorly, that's why your cassette's corny
your money too short for long convo
you in the game hurting, trying to play rajon rondo
millionaire swag, peep your boys ensemble
jewels heavy, prince akeem, coming to america
etcetera, whoever sent the kite, kill the messenger

what?!
spread the propaganda
they tryna stop us from prospering
they don't wanna see us grow
they wanna squash us in
i travel to mountain ranges
acknowledge the change of the climate
i think man's the most destructive climate
but it's another wu saga
continuing like buck rodgers
in the twenty-first century
and we still gotta duck the coppers
on a seaport in newport beach
i see military air carriers on the shores
they had a whole fleet
of weapons of mass destruction with mass production
of war machines that function to secure this world corruption
we cross more streets than frogger
more tweets than a blogger
they perform acts of violence
like they tryna win a oscar
from el salvador to nicaragua
and detroit to divine city
they poison up the auga
anywhere we try to go they try to stop us
they spread the propaganda so we cannot prosper
i guess we better sell some more aquafina
should we just leave our homes like the prophet muhammad left mecca for medina
wow, that's crazy
a mi name swnkah, comin' live
big up rza, mathematics, all wu-tang clan
a we come for chinatown to babylon

if i put my fist through the face of a racist
smack 'em tasteless
would i face three cases in court, locked in places
or shackled to a seat of a bus, a hundred of us
life in america shouldn't be so tough
we got western civilization got me fighting for my civil rights
after fighting scores of war, we still fight for our civil rights
to be equal citizens with equal opportunity
equal chance to advance and uplift our communities
but instead we getting shot in the head
like a black man life ain't worth a loaf of bread
"stop or i shoot," you stop, they still shoot
buck, buck, buck they stomp you out with steel boots

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

they trying to distract us from our practice
and shackle us up, mentally retract us backwards
attack us like the prophet on the way to damascus
it's like we huddle up, had control of the ball, let 'em sack us
now they overtax us as if they want to collapse us
don't be diluted by this foolishness
30 years old man still want nothing do with this
try to find career and a beer on the weekend
and a freak he could take to the crib on the weekend
suv, xm, heat, only plays the weeknd
only wanna fuck you 5 am with no tweeting
honey's 25 should be working but she's twerking
nobodies tripping she could make money from stripping
and i'm sitting in the back sipping my 'yac
can't help but thinking that "what does her father think of that?"
probably because i got a daughter
i heard money mayweather, he makes it rain without water
he dropped 50 g's at a strip club near the border
a dozen women crawling on all fours up
woah, hey, you should've saw her
you should've took that money to a college campus
but then again, i guess momma needed some pampers
but from my view, these wizards need some pampering
even with a lack of substance
and she wonders why, why, why she can't keep her husband?

we come to unite people
every color, every race
every shape, every face
all around the nation
no discrimination
from generation to generation
(oh, why, why?)

it's getting realer
streets gettin' hotter, i could feel it
who am i to put a gun to another
i'm just trying to show love to my brother
hands up, i just pray to god i make it out
is my life not enough, am i hard to love
if it's america we trusted each other knock me down
and i'm just trying to live it up
only one life to live and i ain't trying to give it up

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?

oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why, why, why, why?
oh, why, why?

i became a wrecker through my amplifier
break it down base, treble through my dancer
that's one new dance, it's to my black magic music

reunited, double lp, world excited
struck a mass to the underground, industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
wicked niggaz come, try to burglarize the turf
scattin off soft-ass beats, them niggaz rap happily
tragically, that style, de-ter-iate, rapidly
uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
you couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
where i come from, gettin visual is habitual
de-mon-strate walkin on hot coal, in rituals
i splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
he took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
pierced your internals, streamlined compartments
just consider the unparallel advantage
of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

you're jealous over me because you're not a competitor

try to rock the mic but only will reduce
try to get loose, you juice as a youth
not knowin to yourself that you shall be frozen
i'm the mc warrior, who has been chosen
to rock and shock beats, polite when i recite
sulfur mc's, you are down right, out right
try to be talkative, there's no alternative
hide until i forgive, this motive
i am unique with the perfected physique
the objective of my rhyme is my own technique
i maintain the paradise on this earth
with the shut the fuck up style for what this shit is worth
watch a nigga catch a purse
super-hero niggaz die

50 cash bent in one corner bleeding where pellet hit
my man shawn, he held on strong
slug burn through his lower back side, crack his spine exit his arm
lost him twice on the hospital table and when he died i cried my eyes out
i couldn't take it (damn damn), but the same things continued to happen
niggaz got bust, i'm a kid with a grown man's mind turning corrupt
playing innocent in front of my elders
i was running with them cats that be robbing too, i couldn't tell 'em
if my name was up in any type trouble, my moms would tell me
just like you brothers into some shit go get a job or something

making sure the crib stay tight, for real i wasn't no dummy

you fucking around, yeah you smarter than me
you smarter than me, hee-hee

i don't know, who now, how do it feels since you
no longer have connections, with me, you dumb in
hungry and found this, you must be, your plan is vaulted
you don't wanna play a game, it only works when you young and beautiful
now you should know - how neither of these herbs gassin' you
that would have you boosting clothes
left you hanging, dry and stupid though
so know it's your turn, to play what you give for
your brain's looping slow, you stupid hoe
yeah, you should know, but the foolish don't
you don't get too close, cause you know the truth will show
runner ability, see, is something i went through before

yeah, yeah... i seen this movie before, it's weak
the plotline is very thin
yeah, it lacks substance, very predictible
i give it a thumbs down, i give it a thumbs down

see, i studied psychology since a young'n
so i spot every move, you make
i may not see it clearly through all the street talk
you got beef, walk, yeah i love you, but not like that
you try to stop my act, with your high for looting, childhood retribution
it won't rest til you get, your licks in
vixen victoria's secret stories, you keep within
your witch's brew, for due -- you
fancy as a, not too shroud, denial you choose
but your eyes on the glue, to your inner most
and, when i'm host to your bizarre sideshow, then expose for you

yeah, cause remember the wicked witch
when she looked in the mirror, and then the mirror just shattered and shit
cause she was so ugly and shit... but ugly in the inside though
see you don't dig me, when i'm saying that
you gotta feel me, when i say, that that's the wicked witch

you seem lost so why would you try deviating
from what would seem to be, the clear choice to making
such a situation, such as this, now wake up
i play possible with you, but you gotta do what i say
but you gutter babe, through and through, you ain't have enough yet
pushing pussy for product, having a good time is what you call it
all of it, washed away the mourns of an alcoholic
now you out for my wallet, and give me a hard time too
just to show me a thing or two, about, how low the low be
well don't get cold feet, when you discover i hold heat
to melt that cold heart, that's so weak

you know... it ain't nothing but a thang
see, um, if you start, um, doing something stupid around here
i'mma come out there and i will beat a bitch ass
i will beat a bitch down to the ground
and, i might have to get some paper though
cuz, since you out here already fucking other shit
youknowhatimean, but, you ain't nothing though really
that's you though, you know?
christians say that you can study all day
pray all day, and chant all day
but you get to heaven faster
if you hang with the wise men
yeah i would say once you got inspired spark
y'know, you strive, to, y'know
you gotta put, y'know you gotta keep puttin wood on it as they say
right? keep it burnin or whatever
you gotta find a way to keep it burnin
but then there's the optimum side of it
that's the burnin fire that's burnin but it don't burn
knahmean? just in life, like the sun
you know the sun is seen, like that
but it's like a eternal sun that
that it is on regardless, you just on
you just free from, y'know
shit don't work on you no more

the force to leave you lost, like the tribe of shabazz
murderous material, made by a madman

from the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic
representing with the skill that's iller
dare to compare, get pierced just like an ear
the zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
armed and geared cause i just broke out the prison
charged by the system - for murdering the rhythm!
now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
bound to catch another fuckin charge when i explode


slammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst

rap assassin, fastin, quick to blast and hardrock

formed in very a strong advanced post, east to west coast
ahead of time, competition not even half close
let's say, by no means, an equal value
prematurely brought to play, i'll never allow you
to strike first, so precautions must be taken
and what's worst? when you're just fronting and faking
it's a shame when the sixteen bars are just a waste
and every line or word, is badly placed
even dealing with the narrow window of time
my arrangements, are quick, shutting down your power lines
on a bunch of small puppets, with a wack ass team
that only move, at a push of a button that pull strings
bad boys move in silence, secretly fading in
unlike fake gangstas and ya wannabe made men
acting like they carry the gun that killed lincoln
or they rolling with two hundred murderers from kingston

our goal is to learn y'all niggaz, about this new world order
but i'm still try'nna run up in the president's daughter

college kids and ex- felons feel this

how can he walk off the field during the first inning?
i cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
hate not being there, the minutes before he left
now i'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
i think about him on this song and what he might've said


when i first heard the word, i needed air to clear my head
i know you didn't say what i thought you said, my brother's dead
you crazy, another dirty prank to get the family cranked
ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, i know how you feel
lord, but it's real, and i still can't believe
and my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
ason unique, loved wine and fine women
we singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw" (we like it raw)


can't pretend...
some day it gotta come to an end
but i'ma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
yeah...

i popped a bottle on your born day, god
tried hard not to cry, i still can't hide the scar
and i still ask, why to god, analyzing your form
as i stood there beside your mom
and i share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
should've, would've, could've, had the time, i was selfish
i carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
i really miss you russell, hope you forgive me dirty


yo, these walls i wanna crash, and put my fists through
shout out to dirty, let the whole world miss you
reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
i dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
it's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
soon as the news hit me, i bust out with pain and
rivers i cried, my brother just died
i'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side


ah, man, how do i say goodbye?
it's always the good ones that have to die
it's hard to live without you, god, i shouldn't have doubt you
when you said that the passion of christ was all about you
from the god mobile, to linden plaza, to brownsville
florida to ohio, to putnam, to park hill
you interrupt the grammy's said "wu for the kids"
took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
you've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
crashed cars, still came out without a scar
they tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
so you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
how we treat them hoes? dirt, how we treat them hoes?
we fuck 'em in the butt, dirt


but those mistakes behind me
cast shadows to remind me

god damn man these radio station be buggin
man it's three o'clock in the mornin, damn
this hip-hop shit just keep
damn we got to slow this shit down man, yaknowhatimean?

fiends were never waiting in the hill
they ran one step ahead
but the jiggy was always there

upon the project pavement
there was death, enslavement of the mind
single mothers are filled with stress

as i lay there with my baby
we would look, from the window, and cry
then suddenly in the sky

between the new world ages
we were blessed, and wu-tang fills the ear
with the melody of a train (lord is suddenly here!)

false mc's are melting
in the dark, all the weak lp's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn

god released the tape out, early may

and, i don't think the world can take it
cause it took so long to make it
and the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme

wu-tang, wu-tang, wu-tang

upon the project pavement
there was death, enslavement of the mind
single mothers are filled with stress

between the new world ages
we were blessed, and wu-tang fills the air
with the knowledge that god posess

as i lay there with my baby
we would look, from the window, and cry
then the wu-tang sign appears, in the sky

billboards started melting
in the dark, all the weak mc's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwn

god released the tape of, earthly pain

and, i don't think the world can take it
cause it took so long to make it
and the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme

insert the spasm, yes the dirty hurt has them
thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
exotic wine, holding nine, picasso pictures

it's common sense how i master my circum-fer-ence, you dense
i get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
wu-tang harvest one thousand notches above
mc level, yo, i stay high as like treble
foes who oppose get plucked like rose pedals
arresting and holding, penetrate for better regions
wack mc's only lasted one season
the morale was low at the corral
adjective pronouns had no style, yo, we propose our
aim the official, initial, is ruler zig-zag-zig allah
all that other bullshit ain't permissable
annual increase of the wu-tang manual
handles to a keyboard is true hip hop set tangible
illegible, every egg ain't edible
my tracks remain unforgettable, like ol' nat cole
got to catch this paper to buy shaquasia a glacier
throw chairs to deck a skyscraper
understand that the continents of africa and asia
and free the black man from the enslaved labor, wu-tang


the weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nuttin
we came to punish the glutton with a substance

"hey, mike's -- mike's gonna forfeit this fight"
"he ain't fighting mcdermit"
"he ain't fightin?"
"nope"
"whattup?"
"you talkin bout he -- what he, what he, what he did?"
"told them he cut his eye, in sparring"

my brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
they need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

from dark matter to the big crunch
the vocals came in a bunch without one punch
rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
so you compare contrast but don't blast
through extreme depths, with the pen i hold fast
watch the block thirst for one became all
shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
the blind couldn't verify the authenticity
the rhyme came from the pressure of heat
then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets


these things just took over me
just took over my whole body
so i can't even see no more
i'm calling my black woman a bitch
i'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not

who are rich slave niggas of the poor
who teach the poor lies
to make the people believe
that the old mighty true living god
is a spook in the sky
save the children
and you can't see him with the physical eyes
they're also known as blood suckers of the poor
save the children
and then you got the five percent
who are the poor righteous people who do not believe
the teachers of the ten percent
save the children
who is all wise and know that the true
and living god, and teach that the true
and living god is supreme being black
man from within
otherwise known as civilized people
also muslims, and muslims sons
peace we out

getting money, flipping it
scripting it, record it, fans then applaud it
ship a hundred mil', they bought and took a snort of it

they stiff 'cause their wisdom was stripped when i'm attacking 'em

people say
love is just a energy
dealing with the claim baby

this souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
same kid cryin on the stand with judge cuffner
kissed him with art num it's three to nine style
before he left he flashin his face like denzel
richard dale took his beaver, off the wall pullin his whip
mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
his safe butt was all fucked up, as he had me laughin
god you see how he was laid out, in the grass
with dirt in his mouth, slim woke him up told him he wild out
blood leakin from his teeth he smiled like he gunned out
big bolo, stackin his shit financed a volvo

while i get you flipping off the shit i'm kicking
the lone ranger, code red, danger!
deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
the vandal, too hot to handle
you battle, you're saying goodbye like tevin campbell
roughneck, inspector deck's on the set
the rebel, i make more noise than heavy metal

the way i make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
rhymes rugged and built like schwarzenegger
and i'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
then take all your assets
cause i came to shake the frame in half
with the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!
so if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
cause i grab the clip and
hit you with sixteen shots and more i got
going to war with the melting pot hot

it's the method man for short mr. meth
moving on your left, ah!
and set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
i wanna break full, cock me back
small change, they putting shame in the game

and like fame, my style'll live forever
niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better
but i do, true, can i get a "sue"

sloop, b. a. buh-b. y. u
to my crew with the "sue"


first things first man you're fucking with the worst
i'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
i'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
shame on you when you stepped through to
the ol dirty bastard straight from the brooklyn zoo
and i'll be damned if i let any man
come to my center, you enter the winter
straight up and down that shit packed jam

the ol dirty bastard is dirty and stinking
ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps
niggaz be rolling with a stash
ain't saying cash, bite my style i'll bite your motherfucking ass!

for crying out loud my style is wild so book me
not long is how long that this rhyme took me
ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
here's mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
i love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
i come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stomping grounds
i give a order to my peeps across the water
to go and snatch up props all around the border
and get far like a shooting star
'cause who i am is dim in the light of pablo escobar
point blank as i kick the square biz
there it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

you chill with the feedback black we don't need that
it's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
flowing like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
turn the other cheek and i'll break your fucking chin
slaying boom-bangs like african drums (we'll be)
coming around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
my clan increase like black unemployment
yeah, another one dare,
tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

the wu is too slamming for these cold killing labels
some ain't had hits since i seen aunt mabel
be doing artists in like cain did abel
now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
that's what you get when you misuse what i invent
your empire falls and you lose every cent
for trying to blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
should've pumped it when i rocked it
niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors they're scared to death to pump these
first of all, who's your a&r
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
but he don't know the meaning of dope
when he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
and i'm the dirtiest thing in sight
matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight


yo, yo
never doubt the life
(ehhhh! yo!) yo
who the fuck are you to criticize me?
yo, i slap, yo, i slap dick ta ya wifey
yo (respect, that's my word)

another wu tradition, street vision, listen
all my life i've been poverty stricken
always took what's mines, never was given
a second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision
you can't knock the hustle or the life that i'm livin
quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position
street juridictions, nigga, no restriction
concrete composition for emcee's in submission
special edition crash course mission
push through like the task force and crush all competition
see you from a distance, dry snitchin, whisperin
greet your man posted up like two little bitches
when you get the heart, step live or catch stitches
or find yourself with del, sleepin with the fishes
i got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas
i can't stand the bid when it's all in my business
wu-tang forever and a day, don't get it twisted
i get lifted, i just shoot somethin from hot buscuit

poison darter, news photographers document the horror
while i bounce shaunda with tiwana and i from blue honda
honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar
your highnes, the crowd hollar

when pun was packing a mack in back of the acura
i was dealing in them buildings, it wasn't no cameras
the witness savages, snitching was hazardous, now it isin't
shit is embarrasing, fuck a flow, this is a lyrical aquaduct
sink or swim for what i'm hearing you bagging up
lyte like the mc, i'm 'paper thin', you tripping
i'm taking trips, your eyes don't lie, take a glimpse
into my life, you see me blazing clips, with the green to make it rich
with a team that'll scrape the knicks, and a v that's crazy quick
i came to wear my yankee fitted, represent for greatness
it's lyrical elevation, causing mental stimulation
if i'm getting too deep, i give you a minute to take in
my jewels radiant, like a view of the caymans
and thinking you seeing me, who you playing with?

yo, i got stress on my brain that causes chest pains
inside the best frames ghetto blood clots is scored by slug shots
and drug spots, well if you're too poor to move out
or get a new house, it's like livin in a war walkin through shootouts
and you doubt god exists, when hard fists
be poundin on your head like jackhammers
you're trapped in the black drama, you hear the laughter
seconds after that you fade out, you're played out, you're laid out
your heart nearly gave out, you're lucky that you made out
with just a few scars when the beating ends
but evil men, will soon be on the receiving end
of universal law, i'm callin on the meek and the poor
to fight back and never forfeit the day you have to go to war
with forces that are armed upon the seven continental borders
a mental fortress is essentials to absorb this
my sword hits the human orb until it orbits
in the art of war kids see grym reap be morbid
since pieces of the lost civilization in the past
had my photographs etched inside of pyramids
to laugh at this revelation, without 365 days of concentration
and twenty-four hour meditation, would be foolishly pagan
i'm ancient as 'amen', see i stay grym
throwin fools in in a pit full of pit bulls to be shaken
or strapped to the crossroads of hell and inner sin
which trap the sinners in, to sell such in sing-sing
i bring grym tidings, tidal-ed/titled your wave all not exciting
stop riding the dick, start writin your own shit
cause i stick figures that think they fat and can't rap wind blast
i make em slim fast, lookin like stick figures
i'm all that, i bag chips at concerts and shows
get more panties than hoes that boost victoria secret clothes
foes is tagged like ex-foes toes at the coroner's
kids with cold feet rise and fall like the barometer
grym will mentally chop your career
see shit is locked down here, like penitentiary blocks in tears
escape outta your ducts every time you hear my name
you better duck fate, or catch a fuckin face full of duct tape
you get smacked like a trick that sniffed off her money
then smoked like rzarector with the blunts dipped in honey

rotate your head like a gyro, my hair grows in knotty spirals
feet resembles christ's description from the bible
water-walker, immune to all physical torture
pull out fast in a porsche, upon a double-crosser
my penis rise up in the morning like a phoenix
and blast iron cells into a low blooded 'nemic
the imperial - material's venerial
mc's get murdered in serial, you can't fuck with the material
unorthodox paradox, my shit is seen wide-screen magnavox
grabs thought like doctor octopus
cause war like the grandson of kush
i'm hangin devil's heads on a evergreen bush
sugar-frosted sorceresses bitches get exhausted
pussy lips be drippin, like leaky faucets
undercover c-cyphers sprayed up like windshield wipers
while i'm guzzlin piper's, changin my son's shitty-ass diapers
dime piece trapped in sync like many time piece
you get stampeded by the wildabeast
a rap dast' plus tracks black like chow yun fat
oppositional forces get their eardrums flat
common denominator, i swing the mic saber like vader
he was fooled by the inter-pre-atation made from a traitor
mc's get their wigs blown, trounced off my fistbone
choked from my death, every time they break a wishbone
eventually, i knew the whole world would mention me
potentially, i have the key to make g's
mc's breeze on my tracks, i rock the fruit with the trees
killa bees spread rapid like diseases
see it's, like the second comin of jesus, of nazareth
be fabulous, raise the dead crowd up like lazarus
hazardous vocabulary attacks be beautiful
acoustical notes we provoke, it comes out musically dope
niggaz realize they just can't cope
the hair, bustin out the head resembles fire and smoke loc

i blast watts in circuits like general monk-monk was turkish
my science is divided deep into your central nervous
pervert area codes peep this murder
i'm boxed-in, suckin hologram tits, inhalin oxygen
parallel world of crab niggas and sea shells mix
i pierce my dick and sword right through you pelvics
i'm hell stricken bomb, wrapped in trees of palm
physical existence is descendants of allah
i travel at high rates, weaker men are primates
that either migrate or get burnt to the stake
i feed off lyrical light beams of amphetimene
my terminology is panatomic like lobotomy
crazy el loco, gas niggaz like sunoco
flush em like presto, blast in your chest bone
i raise from the shore, like sodom and gomorrah
with traction, flashin a 4-wheel drive ford explorer
while mucus lies within the center of the rubik's
the roots of the wine induced the enzymes inside your nucleus
turmoil boilin appointed, niggaz rubbin off my style like a ointment
lost in the sahara, from trial and error
confused with 3 meals for sister sara
rahh! bearer, digestin minerals in abundance
because the dead is not known to return from the dungeons
run'din from fires of the city, and tee bloood
blooood, blood, bloooood.. blooood
you two ta both from ee-hee-ma, ah ya both from jahnker
you ta both from fire outside
you both from to-ah-ee
one bloood, one bloood, one bloood

i was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
rugged with my timberland boots that paid
i walk with a slight lean from the way that my heat
givin a green the shine infra-red beam
at the stret traffic light recorders
takin pictures of our corners
cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
the chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
we movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
with plastic phasers in rubber hands
fuck fame, i shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
how dare you call the gods in vein!
not knowin the seriousness of this and why i came
to earth, feet first
i dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
no questionin to the session, i walk with gun
the magnum of bust-es head for many directions unknown
another statistic, change the bolistics
on the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
scrape the craters of the brain for data
old scriptures on withered paper
beginnin take shape and form
when the gods get on it and crash your college dorm

you two ta both from uptown, ah your both from downtown
your ta both from an-ah-town, ah yah both from 'roundtowm
one bloood, one blooood, one blooooood
the pussy 'nit find it
travel w'on, raise your wine
that's blooood yuud, blooood

now verse 2, even more deadly than the first, unrehearsed raw footage
part 2 for you, i give this dedication, project elimination
he's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
i'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
here's jewels to live by
identify before you enter and can't leave with weed
fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
a bum only has one time to explode
when i break i'm takin everything, 
turn the city streets to dusty rhodes
behold this return of the invincible tone
rude like governor tuse and king toustume, 
who gave the order to bust 'em?
don't ask this is genuine draft
blueprint ultimate legit sting international, stone love classical
comin back, to attack in black fatigue
wu-tang and junior reid

you two ta both from lebanon, ah ya both from iran
you da both from china, ah ya both from japan
one blooood, one blooood, one blooood

feelings. the emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. a response or tendency to respond. a belief, which can be vague, illogical, but emotionally irrational

i never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
i rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way i felt
still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
no other emcee could get with me, is way i felt
don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
the first time you heard "protect ya neck", the way you felt
like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how i felt

every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
and we ride out to all of our music is
yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth because we know how it felt
give em knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
so each and every person to recognize what they felt
watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
you never know, how when i first came out, how my brothers felt
i've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
we would last for a night, but a better tomorrow

i felt the angel of death breathe
when i felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
i felt like it was the end of a dynasty
like i was fighting a clique of five chinese thieves
karate slippers with slip on's so i kept slippin'
the floor was too smooth felt like i couldn't catch a grip in
felt like dragonfly jones, was dragonfly tone
so i kept spitting, woke up when i heard the phone

i never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
i take that rapper's belt myself, i feel how cappa felt
i don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
marker, walk on water, i see how jesus felt
no rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
this about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
these boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
i'm not a failure, i couldn't tell ya how losing felt
might not have nailed her, but i can tell ya how spooning felt
remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
i burned the track with a murder rap and i know it's felt

it go; gangsta-gangsta, thug, killa
i'm the black panther that shot the drug dealer
i live on the block, where dudes bust they knocks
ride on top of the car, they crush they rocks
niggaz hot in my fifths, to run from cops
see i'm a nigga too, so i know how niggaz do
keep it real, you should let that bullshit silence
you only been involved in domestic violence
nigga, i chase rentals with long islands
catch us in the club, doing them long, wiling
the microphone marvelous, this marvin haggler
it's so obvious, in the lobby, suave and dressed
where the party is? round trip, flight to laguardia
nobody dodge, when we walk through the audience
dolo, with more dough to blow though
for sure though, slide one deep in a four door
i'm poor though, catch me rocking a lisa lobo
bump yo ho, i want more to the boatload

your coat can't save your soul, but i'm foe
it's written in gold, hieroglyphic egyptian scroll
streets i've been in, from the beginning i'm a legend
never flee up from my enemies, shots i'm sending
musical martyr like john lennon, from the beginning
spit with a vengeance, semi-automatic weapon repping
calm stop, warlock like david geffen
blowin' ox', like oxygen, out of my nostrils
seen brave men, fight for they honor and even die
two gorgeous divas, blowing the heaters down the ride
to the, end of the earth, through hell, water and fire
queens messiah, camouflage black attire
magnum opus, top five, dead or alive
the feds focus my militants, swervin' the lotus
mossberg in the hostess, i write it then release it
then i, bless the street, giving birth to soldiers
rolls gold, king tut piece, flooded with boulders
i praise allah, make this a lot, facing the east
this is for them black and white babies, starving to eat, think differently

poverty stricken, fried chicken, fly rhyme kicking
blind visions from the mind's wisdom, in this crime religion
niggaz listen, what i'm spitting is hard as prison
benches in the trenches, grym intentions, twin doberman pinchers
leather trenches, lead drenches for brat endless
gats eleven inches, ya neck slit it, your head spin it
the epidemic was spread infinite, so once the thread is knitted
for seven digits, it's just business, no disrespect intended
to he who feel offended, a beat down cannot be prevented
big hit it, the game i'm deep in it, until my yankee fitted
switch three, be hanging niggaz, squeeze three eighty triggers
used to fuck my babysitters, now i whip mercedes-benz'
i stand alone, cause i'm grown, for me to crush the walkman
gang lover supporter, of any sort, when i'm new york
rollin' for dolo, the willie bobo gotta go bro
word to jomo, the kid in the polo, got the world in a yo-yo
your happy meal skills is still, no frills
cook ckrills, sign deals, when you see me, just kneel
or rocking mills, your hospital bill
blood from your nostril spill, it's not looking well
when i lick off shots, the hostages yell
chopper fell like ox tail, your optic's swell

ninjas with blades, raised from jungles of wolves
in hoods, where hammers bark and the tennis spark
police on radar, so we stay fogged up
puffin' blunts, sippin' goose, and damage
god damn it's hard, but still, we gettin' by like rhino's
ones that peel, crucified on the earth, for guns and needles
nine inches, hurt, i cause stitches, build
with gods on track, suffering visible scars, it's hard to relax
ready to spaz, no weed, thirst for cash, times moving fast
we like cheaters with masks, lighting cheeba and hash
tryin' to balance the steps, screaming, we need freedom
tired of bleeding, where ego's let out of evil
town is of death, no time for weakness
higher heights to reach, advance the concrete
with iron feet...
yo son i know what time it is
yo tell em, 12, huh? (yo hold the fuck up)
yo shyheim
yo tell me it's on (i'm a punch niggas in the face)
hold that, hold that down son (i got this, i got this)
word up, we got this (fuck that nigga, man)
"shit is real", all you rats on both coasts
brooklyn, shaolin
the block is hot, straight up (pussy nigga!)
(read the rims)

'87, drug, never change their game
we regin terror, projects slang to ring up in the beakle's leather
plaque for the cheddar, shots out the face of the beretta
through the corner store that lady and kid, they caught it raw
smokin' leaf poor, make me wanna crack that nigga's jaw
eatin' with the poor, tryin' to live life for what it's for
twelve years later, caught me on tour two on da road
two on the track, two with the plaques, two with the gats
iced out cats, better think twice before you rap
up in your bitch back, only a snitch get that
fuck the chit-chat, click-click-clack, through your adam's app'
brook-nam grace and charm, remain calm
in these big streets we struggle just to make ends meet
pigs with heat, livin' out the devil's deceit
see i'm a rebel plus my level's complete
bitches say i'm sort of unique
you can catch me as a playboy sheets
solid steel meet, i keep it real with the 'nique

fuck a fair fight, come out my corner with a knife
y'all big elephant niggas beware of us little mice
you know that we like that cheddar, to make our life better
every colour, low sweater, drop-top benz
with the amg letters, floatin' like feathers
does it get any better? (uh-uh, uh-uh) never, no
cause i write the rhymes, the rhymes i write be bumpin'
rhyme architects that be brutal on production
my brick house, you can't blow me down
my thug drug music, smoked out ya town
radio shyheim, you can't choke me out
cause where the fuck i'm from, we moke popo out

shit is crazy real in the field
watch nigga blood get spilled over $5 bills, nigga
and major drug deals on the real
watch a nigga get mils, and his bitch get him killed

yo, p let's get this dough quick, shit on the wrist
platinum bracelets, see his range's the whip

and let his daughter drop a fridge on his
move like the wind to brooklyn bridge, straight to my crib

definitely brooklyn zu
rewind that shit, nigga
wu-tang
holocaust punishment
yo, yo, yo, yo
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

from the hills of the pacific
i bring fury and anger
stabbing devils in their chest with a rusty ship anchor
blood and sand we command and conquer
wasted land,
then expand the regions undiscovered by modern man
body counts increase by thousands by the hour
the sniper on reserve blastin hots from the water tower
absorbin' energy from the sun mc's run
my brain burst like to blow chunks outta you lungs
blood on the pavement
crews gaze in amazement
i was doing that to niggaz who test me on the slave ship
we sell tapes and stage jail breaks for past cell mates
murder you at hell's gate daring bitches to yell rape
and pale face gests hollow points i swallow joints
with romantic charisma that'll make your momma moist
my voice ensemble of bullets rip through your squadron
circulate the planets move back you better dodge 'em
or get opened up like a margin
buddah sargeant,
christ i should've warned you i never missed a target
the living weapon war machine by buried king
relentless remorse is guiltless and unclean
also the sources supreme of my team
black knight brigade peels caps like tangerine
holocaustic, hypnotic, psychotic, sub-atomic,
psychopathic, hyperactive, unattractive

we bring nothing but punishment
like nice be runnin' shit
have 'em runnin' quick
uppercuts is what we coming with
fuck the government
i grab the mic, that's when the thunder hit
never love a bitch
rhymes echo throughout the dungeon pits

something from my culture
i stay to harmony
the way of life that best suits me
i sincerely love allah's mathematics
freedom and raw the abbott
i rest within the square
which is 4 times 90 why niggaz trues dare
the dominant intelligence
99 elements we're offspring celibate
without knowledge life's irrelevant
i wrote the benevolent (wu-tang eminent)

i bring lyrics to existence
when i speak these powerful words
the priest of pandimonium the wargod has emerged
above sea-level that's when thunder rolls
and lightning strike down
atrocity lay that poor ass and rain it for you compund
chaotically the black knights we move erotically
lyrically perform labotamy on your biology a prodigy
a philosophy and theology my idiology's to break down
mc's microscopically
the ghetto tropically gettin' more hectic by the second
ghetto warfare straight bullets hit off the window sectors
and hit kids cause niggaz spit wigs with no precautions
the war i raise down from their grave to haunt your concious
with bloody screams nightmares and bloody dreams
of niggaz haunting you through dark alleyways
through missing smoke screen
have you tweaking like a crack fiend
on high bean like christine
the lords rain supreme


i'm original mallot
with metaphor dominant intelligence
i give a nigga a hardcore detention with his
birthstar invention
i was mentioned i be creeping with the intention
to break free from this evil mad society
don't lie to me
i'm dope, i scope stuff i like to telescope
to provoke from being choked
cause my ability is soul lying
and let me open up your insides
and man hide,
not from confusion with this high energy i'm using
static got you lighting and moving
through the abyss where snakes hiss
and many men get pissed for following false elements
for following false elements

if only we can lay our hands on that vixen yu shin hua
then all our problems will be over...
yu shin hua!
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

the quintessence, father of the hip hop renaissance
my slang been around before baton and benetton
i've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
so when i squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
c-cypher pigs can't identify it
the true and living god, son, we exemplify it
the most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it
bzzz, don't knock it til you try it
flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then i take a swagger
ice cold jã¤germeister, take a dragon hold
bo county crook, slide like the nike swoosh
bruce almighty got more problems than spidey, look
old brooklyn, putnam avenue crook, i've been tooken
all around the world, rooked it then, drive back in brooklyn
good looking, son, yo, son, bring the hook in
you can never find zig weak spot, stop looking

you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

from the continents to croatia, i'll flame a lamester
with the new slang, much more to show ya
these rocks change, glock fully, hot pellets
have me running through the hall, it's on, like you being chased by the relic
can't nothing harm me, yo, i move through any project
with logic, few semi's, hide in the cockpit
scream out, shallah and i'mma tap in, harder than tinactin
don't try to play the fella, i'll blacked in
moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
black man, black hooded, moving through the city
like you batman, still you so pussy, like catwoman
don't bother the legion, more squeezing, more reason
to light a new block up, cause me to cement shit
powerful block shoppers and all niggas getting that gwop
dare you to try to find my weak spot

you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

i stay on the 64 squares, while patrolling the center
trading space from material, the time zone, i enter
it's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
advancements and development, once the pawn reaches
to 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
my opponent's base is threatend, soldiers cut with shanks
moved all my small pieces, mc's are driven back
unable to avoid capture from the attack
such movement, is naturally quite unsound
men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
before the double rooks had approached it
they must of been quick to ignore the principles
rock a v and an effective god is invincible
a strategic plan, just the way i envisioned it
many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment

you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
you thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

i tell you, right, right, right, in ya muthafuckin' face
muthafucka, you know, well, you know muthafuckin' well
when -- we don't play that shit, or, i don't play that shit
that's just wu-tang, you know, i'm the nigga
that -- that, give it to ya raw
when i said "first thing first, man, you fucking with the worst
i be sticking pins ya head, like a fucking nurse
i'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
shame on you, when you step through to
the ol' dirty bastard straight from the brooklyn zu"
if a miracle, could save us from
the travesty, that we've become
if a million sons would stand as one
we will overcome, overcome

the whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
the other day i had to bury my homegirl
wrong place, caught one in her face
plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
for heaven's sake, you pray god open the gate
in this modern day sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a g pack, he chose the whole 8
catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
and the police informer was your childhood friend
in the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
for the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
he's the young capone, he grew up in a drug home
stranded on the ave with a blunt and his gun shown


alive, seen things from the godfather saga
a martin scorsese classic and i'm the author
drama at the opera, crime story novel
tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
meeting place scheduled at the broadway musical
bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
shotgun, the underboss of our main source
of interest, the black widow cocaine empress
a princess rich from her family's inheritance
now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
that was missin' in the last shipment
at first, everything nice, everything routine
jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
but on this day he wasn't ready and my god sense keen
i noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
it wasn't steady when he squeezed


he went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
wearin' tailor-made suits, sky dwellers and clusters
to perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
that pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
you're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
it's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
i'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
contemplatin' murder now, i'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
but it's my man at the same time, i don't wanna do him
he violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
it's over, in the falls of niagara, he was soakin'
with a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'


allah let me lay in your arms
hold me like a newborn, sing to me the most sweetest song
the exalted, the most benevolent
the knower of all, keep me safe 'till i return back to your residence
this earth, my place of birth
as time went through the ages it got worse
sicknesses, beheadings in syria
ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
dear god, it's been a minute since i cried out
since mama died, i never wild out
we need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
can you hear me? can you hear me now?
we need a miracle
destroy the fda for holdin' back cures so they can get paid

yo, yo, yo doodododododo, yo psssh yo
yo park the jeep on the street of the sunset marquis
autograph signin pads wit a gold tip sharpee
permanent ink blots, i'm drunk from red label scotch
while you faggots try to judge my shit like ed koch
underground left and right pair surround sound can't be scared
plea the ams radio tapes that he jammed
golden chrome, desert eagle never left at home
flip the track of the beat watch bobby flip the metronome
high voltage, keep my seed and wiz well cultured
kill enemies by mailin them the poison glue postage
i open or fold ya, dirty fucked a ogre
i leave the cat a book of food stamps used at krogers
the box of evil a fifty sack of that lethal 
adjust these boots and bloody cube steaks from key food

yo, wordup... wordup! ..
you bitches actin like you don't care
you bitches actin like you - yo
razor blade toenails cut holes inside tube socks
gold and platinum fangs unstainable
i chew rocks, cybertech digital suit, deflect bullets
black hooded surrounded by forty acres of wooded - land
like my cousin dusty dirty-ass dan 
fucked the daughter of the leader of the ku klux klan
tapes we dub, pound you wit the ace of club
climb your tree to a shub 
tongue kiss a lion then kidnap her cub
passin it portrait; my bitch spread eagle wild orchid
pussy so wet, you could fuck it wit a soft tipped dick
tickled her tonsil, you could hear her coughin
i don't know if dirt fucked mariah, but i'm out to fuck tyra
starks might fuck mya

i'm the pussy vampire
i don't wanna work no more
i want my own island while i'm whylin

railroad that nigga isotoner coca-cola holder
snatch the granola, sprinkle ginko boloba
venom from a cobra, laced in the cum he bore odor
soaked through a strainer here's a doser

hanna barbera, heart's the opposite of bambi the deer

yo, be for real
i was buried on a battlefield

i was buried on a battlefield
located near israel
the rest of my platoon
was trapped upon a hill
i heard mega...
...yo, be for real

i was buried on a battlefield
i heard megabombs, firearms, and more alarms
and hand grenades, mad rage in evil ways
my destination was to seek life
i mean the stars were so low they appeared as street lights
i was shown the crucifixion by two egyptians
there was war in heaven, i saw christ with a mac-11
so i joined his army, prepare for armaggedeon... armaggedeon...

they told me this, slowly
taking me, into, the mental
orgasms, 'jacualting, stimulating, relating
to life, incubating, rotating around light beams
from a light beam i was formed in the white dream
and then redeemed, like powder, out of, my maker
into, nature, returned, to vapor
killah, priest, was born, in a pillar, of yeast
lost in the miscarriage
the automatic, for marriage
the body is a vehicle for the mind
you realize that your body, is basically vacumnin that space
into somethin from within this body
this is why the air must come in, every breath
look at - i say look at odb, okay
a free man for real, knahmsayin?
his his expression of freedom, his what he wanted to do
it was very free, one out of a million people
could deter him, from an idea, y'knahmean?
cause he was free to express like that, y'knahmean?
for the supreme architecture
that's the one who come with the most illest ideas
the one who come with the illest creation
a supreme architecture is actually someone who build the universe
if i personally say i'm the supreme architecture
i'm i'm lettin allah speak right, right there knahmsayin?
i'm speakin right through that, i'm i'm becomin a vehicle


word it's like the truth
they say the truth shall set you free
you hear the truth, it sets you free
so, mathematics is truth
when it adds up, there's no error
the only time there's an error
when man miscalculate his own... problem
knahmean his own equations
are we not the strongest? huh?
i say we move with power and strike now!

yo, it's like this, yo

when i'm locked down i use timbs as my shower slippers
i'm in the background, mingling with the powder flippers
in the basement, hard body, power lifters
i crush shower in the sifters, see how i lift her?
universal god, i stay scientific
the kid with the golden arms, iron fister
stay asiatic, so cinematic
noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
it's hood politics, that bring the hunger back
i'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
check the catalog, put out a hundred packs
watch for drug sniffing dogs, they coming from the back
i'm straight thunder clap, the funky drummer's back
it's pure dopium, give 'em a heart attack
i stay stacking plaques, like ancient artifacts
joe namath in the game, i'm the quarterback

yo, eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
pounds in the trunk, get you a concrete scenery
hand made ox'll get you duffed in the mess hall
snitch niggas run to c.o.'s to confess all
this is street knowledge, now that i school college
like a speech from the gza, sharp like the rza
go run with a scissor, nigga, the true fizzer
truth number, drop a few jewels in the booth
used to boost cracks, stuff 'em inside of a tennis ball
and throw 'em when they rushing the block, trust no cops
driving around with two mitts in my socks
cooked coke'll get you more trouble then money
don't crawl with the dust juice, the pigs is hungry
you think they ain't watching, they watching, while you uptown copping
back home, while you cooking and chopping
they scheming on the block, waiting to get it popping

he had a sword and an ax that cuts
under a robe that was woven from silver and gold and waxed it up
his army was so great, the quantity
his crops and life stock, boost the economy
many will travel by boat to see him
his image adorn most schools and coliseums
a merchant hustle those silk and velvets
portrait illuminated when the torch was well light
picture so beautiful painted, that
one thought agree to move, cuz it will leave a mood
or energy, you see his wife practice yoga
made herbal enhancers that have saved the soldiers
god with treasures, in the chambers, halls and votes
well prepared for all assaults, heavy guarded village
armed with the sharpest weapons, designed to pierce
and cause blood spillage

from a young teen, my murder team inspired by crimes
see allah just' granted permission, for my position
so now i write rhymes escaping this repetitive cycle
swinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
teaching ya'll mathematically, come see
the epitome of what you wanna be, m.c.
my semi auto gun, mandatory at the sound clash
the mic touch, dance mouth shut, pounds of the best
green, glass bottles of don, i sip the liquor slow
flow so devastating when i go solo
even when i'm dolo, pretty gun i'm holding
head swollen off the solid gold soul
iron mic pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
livin' life royalty, all wise and healthy
welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
never stopping my trajectory, i'm galactic

yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
we've been building like this ever since the first day of birth
the more i start to build, the better i feel
keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
you not god body, son, you just garbage and real snotty
cherry head gaylords still stuck in the lobby
this the first now born, son, i'm blessed with mad lessons
conquer crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
you can't fast with me, and avoid the swine
you degenerate mc, i'm the best of mankind
allah u akbar, straight jews and real stars
i'm down with the rza, got help for the widow son
pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me dunn-dunn
original taizeen, holy water, the visine
designated wordplay, god respect my dean
shine on little stars and respect the queen

new york giant, call me deck umenyiora
fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
my job is done, once i get into the border
pedico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
hypodermic needle to the groove, i dose veins
overdose ya, you know the product is raw, right?
lines take you there like i wrote it with off white
got 'em bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
sorry, no consignment, get your ends up
move from the gate now, he on his way straight to jake, now

blowin' smoke through the viper pit
hold a listener tight, mic constrictor
words from the theater, swift as krishner

toad style is immensely strong, and immune to nearly any weapon
when it's properly used, it's almost invincible

homicide's illegal and death is the penalty

merciless like a terrorist hard to capture

plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
this technique attacks the immune system
disguised like a lie paralyzing the victim

erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
moving on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
and injure - any motherfucking contender

we were at the same table when the chips were checked
a gamblin +rebel+ who +inspects+ the +deck+
just when you thought we would fold our hand
against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
it was live on air but in between station breaks
i was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
split the demos, put insurance on tapes
a safeguard against the crusaders in capes
if i double down they say the gods are sharks
if we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
we draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
while the dealer promoted the full house venue
a spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
the high roller who got credit upon signin
they look puzzled when i shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
recourse of bluff game's your muscle

children on the grass playin' ball and twister
fresh lemonade is made, we playin' spades
my nephews turn the livin' room into an arcade

your mac is big, got a little grip, yo
you think that shit gon live what he did -- what this nigga said
remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
it got back to me some niggaz in medina askin me
"you know some niggaz in the gold e-class," splash to me
yo that shit you had in vegas
yo, it coulda got us both sprayed up, they seen the ac, know this traitor
hair sa-laundry and shorty like karan
her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
octavia with all the ice on, yo

"..face responsiblity"
she fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto street"


yo all of y'all niggaz got the whole story wrong
talk what you talk but twist the real song
when it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
show y'all niggaz whose style is more liver
this is not a act this is more actual fact
nuttin but experience placed upon track
with the true sound, not lyin out the crown
when we not workin we hardly be around
yeah see the light, right now we could fight
you not a real brother you just a fake type
that get on the mic then, throw your cliche
half the east coast soundin just like rae
if you a gambino, give credit to the flow
if you not a part of this kid act like you know
fuck the studio, cappachino the great
fly cherry head niggaz like planes out of state
i ain't friends with you, only my cd hit you
if you want some then stop frontin is the issue
it's my turn, live niggaz could pass
two-face-ted rappers push they shit last
straight off the edge, into the rubbish
peep my new style fuck cristal and moet
i drink evian water while my thoughts get published

"what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
what you gonna do when you grow up..."

"what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
what you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"


one is invulnerable, in fact
it involves strenuous breath control
out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
the human body has a hundred and eight pressure points
thirty-six of these can be fatal
the remainder, paralyzing
shh, shh, shh, shh, wu, wu, tang, tang

the joy the flowers bring me
the pain still has me sinking
all while my heart gently weeps
your smile has got me shrinking
the tears in your eyes are twinkling
because the heart gently weeps

snowy night, fiends basin, a raisin in the sun was amazin
the joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
jumped up, fish tank, it fell, and they stuck
they shot her cousin lavon, he owed a buck
willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
grits fell on his leg, kiana ripped the cold bowl
he violent, an island nigga with the talent
of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin
robbin everything in macy's, lacy, short haircut
with long arms who fuck niggaz, got four babies
yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
she did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
lester, smoked chester sister vest, i heard it was a mess
they ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
hungry hyenas from medina, all eight trainers
who got reluct', think fast and blast from beamers

yeah, yo
i brought my bitch out to pathmark, she's pushin the cart
headed to aisle four, damn i got milk on my clark's
that's what i get, not focusin from hittin that bar
my mouth dried, need plenty water quick, i feel like a shark
in the aisle bustin them paper towels and wipin my wally's down
i stood up to face a barrel, he's holdin a shiny pound
it's him, he want revenge, i murdered his uncle tim
i sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
and uh, she brought her babyyyyy
she knew i hard the murders, a smack
it killed her man though, now i got his fuckin nephew grippin his gat
you know you're bootyyyyyy
you pulled your toolie, out on meeeee... motherfucker
first thought was to snatch the ratchet
said fuck it and fuckin grabbed it
i ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fuckin laughin
i wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
he wouldn't let go the joint, so i fuckin bit him
shots was whizzin, hittin clorox bottles
customers screamin, then the faggot ran out of hollows
i had to show him what it's all about
next thing you read in the paper, "a man who came to kill gets knocked out"

i don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
man's not supposed to cry...
though we're just babies, and you're so crazy
how tears of joy bring so much life

yo, aiyyo yo yo
you on your way to the store nigga grab me a dutch, i'm mad as fuck
my dude, my count was short when i was baggin it up
now i need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
what's up with officer brown? the other day he tried to shackle me up
he killed kase and now he hasslin us
this motherfucker got balls, even the gall to try and pattin me up
time to re-up, let these niggaz know we back on the block
with three hundred off a g-pack, crack in the spot


what y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
i'm the osiris of this shit
wu-tang is here forever motherfuckers
this like this ninety-seven
aight my niggas and my niggarettes
let's do it like this
i'mma rub your ass in the moonshine
let's take it back to seventy-nine

i bomb atomically socrates' philosophies
and hypothesis can't define how i be dropping these
mockeries lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me
battle-scarred shogun explosion when my pen hits
tremendous ultra-violet shine blind forensics
i inspect you through the future see millennium
killa beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets queen beez ease the guns in
rumble with patrolmen tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor die-hard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow swinging swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked performing live on your hottest block

as the world turns i spread like germ
bless the globe with the pestilence the hard-headed never learn
this my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
transform into the ghost rider a six-pack
and a streetcar named desire who got my back?
in the line of fire holding back what?
my peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
it's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm what the blood
clot we smoke pot and blow spots
you wanna think twice i think not
the iron lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
guns of navarone tearing up your battle zone
rip through your slums

i twist darts from the heart tried and true
loop my voice on the lp martini on the slang rocks
certified chatterbox vocabulary 'donna talking
tell your story walking
take cover kid what? run for your brother kid
run for your team and your six camp rhyme groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
my deadly notes reign supreme
your fort is basic compared to mine
domino effect arts and crafts
paragraphs contain cyanide
take a free ride on my dart i got the fashion
catalogues for all y'all to all praise to the god

the saga continues
wu-tang wu-tang

olympic torch flaming we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory the agony defeat
we crush slow flaming deluxe slow
for judgment day cometh conquer it's war
allow us to escape hell globe spinning bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tunes spit the shitty mortal kombat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle junkie vigilante tantrum
a death kiss catwalk squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom tranquilized with anesthetics
my orchestra graceful music ballerinas
my music sicily rich california smell
an axe kill adventure paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing-sing sipping on ginseng
righteous wax chaperon rotating ring kings

maech or the wooden soldiers c-cypher-punks couldn't hold us
a thousand men rushing in not one nigga was sober
perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like flair
escape from your dragon's lair in particular
my beats travel like a vortex through your spine
to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
heart terminal like grand central station
program fat basslines on novation
getting drunk like a fuck i'm ducking five-year probation

war of the masses the outcome disastrous
many of the victim families save their ashes
a million names on walls engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for their acts
another heart is torn as close ones mourn
those who stray niggas get slayed on the song

the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
ninety-three million miles away from came one
to represent the nation this is a gathering
of the masses that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle the crowd now screams in rage
the high chief jamel irief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save self from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

yo! yo! yo fuck that look at all these crab niggas laid back
lamping like them gray and black puma's on my man's rack
codeine was forced in your drink
you had a navy green salamander fiend
bitches overheard you scream
you two-faces scum of the slum i got your whole body numb
blowing like shalamar in eighty-one
sound convincing thousand dollar cork-pop convention
hands like sonny liston get fly permission
hold the fuck up i'll unfasten your wig bad luck
i humiliate separate the english from the dutch
it's me black noble drew ali
came in threes we like the genovese
sazon season these degrees
it's earth ninety-three million miles from the first
rough turbulence the wave burst split the megahertz

aiyo that's amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk
connect dots to make my man child walk
swift notarizer blue-tang all up in the high-riser
new york yank' visor world tranquilizer
just a dosage delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean see y'all the number one draft pick
tear down the beat god then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor flex the white-gold tarantula
track truck diesel play the weed god substantiala
max mostly undivided then slide in sickening
guaranteed made 'em jump like rod strickland
countdown...
are you ready? are you mad inside?
got you strapped down to your seats
outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
god speed, approach follow my lead
firewinds gust, empire crush
full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
soundwaves slay out the back, ?cave? smoke
my belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
down slope, elegant as fantasia
killer whale tale inhale, black male from asia
all out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
no match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
in the shaft, shotty cop, hip hop to the limit
nightwatch, pad mark
sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
gimmie what it takes now!!

rage rock roll fight
brawl fall rumblllllleee!!!

the diabolic witty, dialect's darker than gotham city
wit the possibilty to stop your walkin ability
god forgive me, spark enemies wit pistol grips
the missle tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
official scripts strikes when physical hits
you physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
liver than wwf warzone
walk upon ? tracks, bodies collapse
rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
logical facts from the terror dome
spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
in god you now entrust
dog you like hound and mutts, pound pups get sound struck
clown what? you'll get drowned in the cut
while crowd round up


aiyyo yo
i spit bars
travellin tremendous speed measurin far
been bustin satellites circlin mars
verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
of a hundred wild niggas piled in a trojan horse
thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
this music, is mind control like computer chips
been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
wit turbo tactics, manuever like a trained soldier
hall of fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
ayatollah, high roller nine totter
mind controller, 2009 time folder

wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
spittin hazardous darts, up front like rosa parks

declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
police squads tryin to bogard, we rip and rob
the boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
in the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
so goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
rusty-ass .38 special, niggas owe me
slowly i turn, face the one and only
naughty by nature, i do my dirt all by my lonely
ask pretty tony, when i got a bitch i keeps a bitch
36 chambers, enter at your own risk
take that watch off and tuck your necklace
city never sleeps, streets is restless
rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
wu-tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
i deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

they just seen us comin', blew a flat
pulled over to the shoulder
pop the trunk to see if it's a spare in the back
a van pulled up, with florida tags
three men jumped out with guns drawn and they all wore masks
snatched me up and handcuffed me
hit me with the butt of the gun
i'm thinkin' to myself, "the war just begun"
thirty minutes in the ride, the mask came off
the chickens dropped, the two in the back had russian accents
askin' who my connect is, where he rest shit

branded by the steel iron, bullets flying
ladies being hit through wickedness, i'm losing my grip
i thought we lived by the books, the bible, koran

they threw burners in our babies' faces
pale hands that looked scary touched our bodies in the strangest places
sweat from the white man's head
fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head, almighty

they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
before you hear that i decided to tell, i'd rather die in a cell
i was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
scorin' money like the meter on the yellow cab
give the witness an unexpected visit
make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
like, "i was on the ground, i ain't see him bustin'"
now the da chasin' a plea, they hatin' i'm free
the case is mistaken identity

whoever push me like pusha t, i push back
i push a cap, before '93, i pushed crack
i'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good scrap?
i'm smokin' rappers, you are a l, what's good smack?
hold up that's goods rap, pardon self
i just like good rap, but when i see goods i give his goods back
i rap for riders that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
to 25 to lifers that jack mac
we movin' ratchets, no kat stacks, it's magic
the way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
i'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
when life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
before you try and get my head, get you some pampers
then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
kick in my vicinity, i'm what rappers pretend to be
charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity

mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
check my id, wu-tang, that's the legacy

fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
two suitcases, dangle on his hands
he opened up the door, headed up the stairs
thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
first sight he saw, struck him by surprise
two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
windows blown out, no prints on the door
all he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
but he was bangin' mrs. prixy at the motor lodge
he got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
the screw fit the judge, he might take the fall
someone set him up, a botched robbery
mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be

17 years old, i'm headed back to the hole
mistaken identity, every way was sold
i look like a hoodlum, i rock a lot of gold
they lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
i ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
the beast pat me up, they won't let me off

na-n-n-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
it could never been the g-o-d, not me
you terribly mistaken, son, i ain't the one
we could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
what resemblance does he strike? so my mic fahrenheit
w for my a-alike, your dna match tight
even if they bite us, close but not quite
they still tryna get it right, mistaken identity


it's wu, ah goin on


reunited, double lp, we're all excited
struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
wicked niggaz come, try to burglarize the turf
scattin off soft-ass beats them niggaz rap happily
tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
you couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
where i come from, gettin visual is habitual
de-mon-strate walkin on hot coal, in rituals
i splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
he took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
just consider the unparallel advantage
of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage


bitch ass niggaz counterfeit the funk
i smoke the bead and the skunk, tree top of the trunk
moonshine drunken monk, yahead, get shrunk
the touch of skunk, i be fuckin bitches by the chunk
my name black, do words wanna play in my dirt?
bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church
i come like a thousand doves
bitch you quiet at the bus, makin the fuss, i gots tough love
unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse
dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze

gold and platinum frisbees on my wall, lookin properly
but come-ly, i u.f.o. you wright brothers
the indian that sold manhattan to the white man
my grandfather, step up and get knocked right the fuck out
come to the cook-out, dirty bitch at the mouth
you scared? run around like a plane about to crash


yeah... and rza


yo, yo, the riddler, funny bone tickler, freak caligula
bigger dick sex enigma pistol fertilize your stigma
stinkbox, order from pink dot
mc's get stuck on ink blots as i plug to the sinkbox
wu-tang incorp. take your brain on spacewalk
talk strange like b-jork, great hero jim thorpe
how can i put it? life is like video footage
hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
i'm too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
attack when you least notice through explosive postage
i don't play, the rap souflee sautee for the day
ruler zig-zag-zig a, leg leg arm head
spread like plague, we drink hennessee by the jig
i got the golden egg plus the goose
eighty proof, absolut, mixed with cranberry fruit juice
ginseng boost, i got yo' neck in a noose
keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
sixteen bar nickle sell more copies than kinko
grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
and we return like jesus, when the whole world need us


is it appetite for destruction
slap a murder rap on this production, i touch somethin trust nuttin
iron lung/twisted metal
i see em duckin my dart gun, bustin, from every angle
worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
that be code named agent orange, killin you slow

for you in the world (my wu-tang slang is that new york city crack)

silly rabbits, trynna disrespect the abbott
don't you know that we'll turn your cold body to maggots
i got forty million records sold, some platinum, some gold
some we just put out to meet the tax code
your career will be shorter than the 21st of december
be one of those thousand rappers no one remembers
while my name is carved on trophies, colleges recite my bars
you can look up, and see my name up on the stars
and when it comes down to that basic talent
i got 20 little cousins that can meet your challenge
yo, stop and listen, and check this proposition
son, got lots of vision, plus lots of wisdom
hindsight, foresight, insight, out of sight
some try to imitate, but they are not alike
they only piggy back, have a digi snack
that wu-tang slang is that new york city crack


we're just dealing, of a man
tough take before you
a cryptic to your power
the reason why we slept and spared your son's life
was to give you faith
thank you, man, thank you
you fight well, the hand must reach to the sky
save the best for me, and have perfect breathing
good breath control, you know of these

look, vibe with me
rhyme is tricky, who ridin' with me
who kinda miss me can kinda miss me, you kinda iffy
don't know the history? i'm from the city of stop and frisk me
the cops is jiggy, they spot the blickey then try and get me
my pops a willie, said "give her fifty, she pop her kitty"
he bad boy and he poppa really, it's not a biggie
see my committee, block offici', it's not an ishy
or i'm too lazy to cross roads, if not, i'm busy
it's not a mystery who shot ricky, but where the difference
between the trã© and the dough, boy, we bred different
so bear witness, this can leave you with head missing
if y'all can hear me, i guarantee you the feds listening
so i be spittin' in barcode, nothin' left in the tap, dog
and after the last call, the bar close
they spark cohiba, cigar blow
even tony stark knows the tension is thick as wallabee clark soles
but did i mention i'm sick and gotta be hardcore
hard-boiled, taking your base, that's what we ball for
money over bimbos, that's what the mob for
rappers stuck in limbo 'cause they were settin' the bar low
every time i rhyme on a track, it's like a combo
king, we put the nine to your back, it's like you rondo
when it come to john, though, i'ma slaughter a john doe
drag him through a drive-thru like he ordered the combo
hands on him, we wild style with the cans on him
then come defeat, that's my beliefs and i stand on 'em
give you the beats, no doc dre or brands on 'em
some band want 'em, these verses hot and the fans want 'em
i'm from the school of them hard knocks with harder standards
i've been a hard rock before they added the arm & hammers
i'm at the nana's, bogus method, we call it bama
gun on the camera so we can shoot them in panoramas
na-nana-nana, i'm feelin' petty but watch your manners
use proper grammar so we could stop with the propaganda
no type of slander but tell them hoes 'i'm not your santa'
just want the body, nobody tryin' to pot-and-pan ya
cop scanners, a fuller house but we not the tanners
if shooters bringin' them hawks out, then it's not atlanta's

if time is money, i got time and time saved
i pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
nobody get 'til i got mine, my mind made
if time is money, i got time and time saved
i pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
nobody get 'til i got mine, my mind made
"don't pursue him.
it would be dangerous.
because that might force him to kill you.
and he would not hesitate to do that."

"may i know your name?"

"you two men, i assume are new pupils of the temple."

"yes!"

"hmm, i am hee mai."

"pejah."

"i was ordered by your reputed abbot
to enter into retreat here.
it seems destiny has so arranged things
that we meet here.
now tell me what particular styles
of kung-fu you are learning here."

"i am learning boxing."

"hmm. well i'll teach you boxing.
and also how to use the whip.
however, in return for this though
you must do something for me."

"could you tell us what you'd like us to do?"

"i have two serious female disciples.
one is mau tru wah, and the other is win len jong.
my husband died. he was killed some time ago
in a battle with the wu-tang."
high potency top, smoke a bag of black
and feel the vibe, wanna be wise 
we, form on a rising corner mean five
laws in disguise, throw on your slides
young niggas racist, smokers is basic
we seen the eyes, laying up playing the cut
what, stay in the truck, something told me duck
folding me up, my shoulders struck
out of luck, fuck the potters up
fell on a daze like a golotta snuff
niggas tried to body me up
i'm in the lobby bleeding
niggas in the witness office probably eating
and sprinting and beefing, when they heard the shots
called the precinct and seen barber nieces beasting
niggas shot shalar features and shocked her was a elisis, 
bent the spinal cordless creatures
i'm gagging and flagging a cab down
guess who in the benz wagon, dragging my sound down
macking it was dale breedy the greedy
caniving ass snake genie
cop with a bikini will murder charge and benini
i'm feeling wheezy and the drain from the cheeba
grieving ain't even looking decent
seeing police niggas reaching

that splash against my hollow bones
that rocks my...

fleeing the crime scene speeding
beefing leaving behind cream
not even peeping that i was leaking
won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
still jakes are creeping
don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend
keep the ruger peeling who's squealing
few knew the dealings
keep the steel concealed in
cause we got no time for feelings
eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
feel like, a superhero talking like a true deniro
they boost his ego path and broke down
reduced to zero
cops feel we poors hoping i'll reveal my source, source

that splash against my hollow bones
that rocks my soul
oh oh, oh oh

outside the check cashing, flashing
dipped in fashion
five cherry-faced fagots tried to cash in
they keep laughing, ghost you get ya face bashed in
who gave you these priveledges son? why you maxing?
and we..
feigning to take those move slow
i'm hearing how you broke rob's nose
and i heard you keep a banging hammer
golden brass diamonds embroideries
that was stolen that you haven't reported g
make very little noise, my shit hiccup
don't make this big stick up bigger
me and the boys i thought for a second then chose
rather than froze
had the jim star on my hand
yo what the fuck yo! that's when i ripped timothy
snatch and dip john like imbaggable
had the mini axe tool, faxed him
shots rang off, bing, boggle-de-dum

that splash against my hollow bones
yo, one two one two
wu, tang, wu, tang
it's the wu, creepin in the shadows
wu, tang, wu, tang
(wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang)
"oh baby, for heavens sake"
sir i, excalibur
"oh baby, for heavens sake"
"oh baby, for heavens sake"


yo, aiyyo my rap style swing like willie mays
my eyes purple haze, my solar razor burn through shades
my grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
i glide like, hovercrafts on the everglades
boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
limited edition composition spark friction
non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
wu original, true colors step from the melanin
the most high, most try, to get close by
and overthrow i, but choke, with they hopes up high
i circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the richter
flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
the crowd seducer black your third eye before i lose ya
verbal high i leave stars in the eyes of medusa
top ten, parley like cochran, it's often
narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
murder rap, kill you soft like roberta flack
words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks

wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake" 


now all pay tribute to this entity
a spark that surges through the undergrowth
overwhelmin the populace from the entry
the wu-tang dynasty, has emerged
from this elite fleet
i was appointed to strike the vital nerve
mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
seeds of mc's at these fake ass industry niggaz
feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
and spray, an array of shots
that travel downwind, just respect pyrhiffic pen
as i send, the minds of the weak
to rise and take power i blew tower-ing over the land
as we stand, expanding our cream
a dollar to every grain of sand
let the mind use the physical as planned

"oh baby, for heavens sake"
wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake"


yo, yo, this is beirut
try to comprehend check out my new suit
gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid lp's everywhere
fallin out the sky tall sniper
raps by cappadonna hit the countryside
poetry whirlpool, rza and true collide
we produce article exception to the rule
we the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
cats that made that watergate thing go spoiled
the heavy-handed, locked down stranged with cyrus
wu pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
slang reverand, put the best work in

wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
"oh baby, for heavens sake"
at 3:47, more than 150 rounds of ammunition were fired into your apartment
which was about 200 yards away

blowing herb metals, black son still gravel
bronzeman, oblong javelins in my cabinet
detroit submit seeds, salutation from the missile plant
quick to the hollow point, it ain't no olive branch
my low cal, four oh cal in the cardigan
tempted by satan, put a bullet in his diaphram
walk around black clouds and quiet violins
italian fire blends, poet and violent pens
illest ill, scotch deal, plots and iron winds
up hill near the ghetto spill, the sirens sing
street dreams, black seed and the inspired kings
from fire water veins, still rain mystery
and chains due to my roots, no doubt in the ring
on the road to riches and diamond speech
i might turn a bag and wash sand in the mountain peaks

yo, i don't text to send messages
my testosterone stimulate her estrogen
whether black, caucasian or the mexican
asians, she get the message and she coming back for sex again
organic drugs, my natural persuation
you under the influence of 36 invasion
spider-man amazing, but i'm darker than parker
skin got abrasions from maria and tasha
sliding down a street pole, pull up to your party
stimulated with a jeep full of cherry gap honeys and bottles of vodka
plus the weed bowls, here we go
meditating, never jealous, over zealous
wu-tang clan's my fellowship, fans massive acapellas
of our lyrics, would be with tracks embelishes
the idea clearer that wu-tang forever
this, way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness
enjoying by god, no man could sever this

sometimes i pull my boxers down, ya'll, with one timb on
it be times, you know i stay away when her friends on
for some reason, she be really hot, when her friends gone

that pretty mole above your lips looking cute now
ooh child, i'm patient, my mind's telling me
to stay calm, i wanna get it off like a g bomb
on top of your skin, i'm sliding it in
when i'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again
then we can hold on through the night, fan on and covers on
it's bright from the tv light, peace, good night

looking out my window, sun shining bright
birds are singing, trying to make things right
now i got music, oh, on my radio
and i can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors
now i don't want no one, on the catch me side
but ever since you left, said goodbye

i wish you were here with me
i said i wish you were here with me
i wish you were here, with me

and thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me
seen our love, is never gonna find me
and i keep looking, oh, for that brighter day
when all i see is, time slipping away
oh and i got to talk, to keep myself together
but all i see is stormy weather

aiyyo dunn this song is called sunshower
cause we approachin the final hour
you know i ahh all i can say to my brothers and sisters right now
is stay close to your families, and all your loved ones
cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
they killin for pennies, knahmsayin?
peace to the gods, we got a heavy job... yo, yo

trouble follows behind a wicked mind, 20/20 vision
of the prism of light but still blind
because you lack the inner, every sinner
will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
you cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out
you remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external
along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
and permanently upon this journey
through the journal of the book of life
those who took a life without justice
will become just ice ice ice
it's been taught that your worst enemy can harm you
as much as your own wicked thoughts
what devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint
now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
with rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans
burn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
i'm convinced, allah is god always has been always will be
you could travel every square inch of the planet earth and still be
ninety-three million miles away from the sun
til you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge
know the ledge to where your heart is
or fall off into the internal hell that's uncharted
light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second
through time and space, until it reach a target
and once we're freed of darkness, and show em where the path
yo as the red sea was parted, into these straight
at the narrow gate, but why that's a road to destruction and hate
what you thought life was a sport? a game?
one hundred years short, know the soul is immortal
walk through many portals, and those who go astray
will pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked bullshit
ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
with dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate
instead, i chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
of life and fed god degree of light to my head
it's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so i stay awake
and take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin
so we can see each other, cause every color
that makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?
who's the original, who's the biochemical
who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital
digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
while niggaz minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
the sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em
stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum
and shatter bone fragments
cops love the block you gettin backed up by dragnet
thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
flippin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block nobody's havin it
those who haven't learnt get returned
you freaky ass niggaz get burned
some walk around like they ain't concerned
with the hell goin on inside the world
why do grown men molest little girls?
is it because the girl's breast has swelled
to the size of a woman, although she's twelve
the whole world is sick, sick, sick
trapped up in six, six, six
i started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
tryin to carry on, wishin i had a bomb to blow up babylon
a vagabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon
goin in circles, like a ferris wheel
undernourished meals i cherish hope, drown inside the sea of life
use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night
to far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
you couldn't see a spark of light
while others play ball, i recall, me and gza, dirty
hangin in halls, bangin on walls
kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
boostin from freeport sunrise to amityville morgue
kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws
started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
to wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
so pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
to funnel the p-funk, smokin woolie blunts
dust cocktails and primos, shot more dice than casinos
back when wu-gambinos were called f.o.i. mc's
all and together now crew b.c.c.
rec posse, g.p., d.m.d.
ol dirty stalked east new york gza maintained franklin lane
i was going to thomas the jeff, where students got slain
old earth got nervous walked me to shaolin sent me to curtis
took share time in marquis, u-god general contractin service
while meth chef and deck was off the nu-dol
for white boys who took steroids
buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
back when our girlfriends was virgins
cuttin class with ghost tryin to bag hoes in mary birchem
a maybeldine beacon night school washington irving
these young gods was seekin
hoes in westinghouse and clara parton and medina
girls who sung like sarafina
on the corner of belmont and picket avenue i seen her
as if i dreamed her
i was dead broke, now i will use key notes to make g-notes
so it's always hope
see subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
to the heart of medina, but shaolin is the brain
so take heed to these words
and feel the power of the sunshower

approachin the final hour
power equality, allah sees everything
let's come together under the wings

"since you're all so skilled,

yeah... riff raff...
uh, weathermen, hieroglyphics, what up? ok

riff raff, alley, when i boom slang, drip draft
venom with a new twang, same swagger, new thang
whose gang, a stagger with similar dirty worms
who occasionally cluster up the service and observe
a.r. periscope, blast through the terror dome
zoo wanna shark attack, clash til the thrill is gone
bark back, fresh off the pharmacy, counter doubter pop
blame it on the overly, eggy, farming a power crops
dark wing when i pioneer deer, croppin' the odds
with all the proper sparkers and cogs
i bounce with a seventh sin, equipped with a foul jour moment
waiting for that great celebrity towel throwing

and you niggaz know what time it is, it's preservation
the national guard, it's me and aesop
rock, stopping any operations against the fence
del is quick to dispense, with foreign elements
back, y'all the anchor attribute to the decay
strives who plays, map your route, cause aesop is absolute
del? he practice shoot, basket hoops, capture fools with lasso loops
hip hop needs two veterans such as us, who ain't never scared
to tear it there, hard to tell, vegetarian and aware of it
therefore, tearing can take care of it, ok, ok

i bang on doors, pay rent, lampin' to birth complaints
rip flipper, make rap music during commercial breaks
starring galapagos island, evolution mutant
through the one man species, shaking leaches off his puma's
beach run ashore, on whores, and contaminated play
spout try'nna out the older alligator fade away
make us stay, please, i chisel the missile gently
blast in the wagon, middle finger, condescends me
green earth bum, walk a right plank, he burst one
but yo, keep the rugged play, i'm never stumped
aes' hid the drum, keep paint under his lung, ugly
who can know a dog runs more than a rutty puppy

you better have appreciation for this
d-e-l, i'm so hungry, man, i'm tastin' the shit
and the, girl you just replaced an abyss
and it's a bitch, just needle action, like an itch
the only reason why i like to strike it rich
is to be able to keep the flow, that's how deep it go
hahahahaha, steels...
you bout to catch this vick
yo, you bout to catch this vick

old sad ballads and gun permits was invalid
raspberry vinegar, red dripped in spinach salad
sippin' bitches, cabanet grape, steaming halibat steak
gold plate is stainless, four forks scrape the single plate
chased by a shot of scotch whiskey, brew brisky
for sixty years, misty bottles of crysty in the freezer
red twist leaf, melted in spliffy, cali blunt piff
now we lifty, mc dread head, split up and smoke swiftly
then if we empty the safe we can all catch fifty
vanna piece put eighty five in jewelry
two sixty in deep, a half a gallon digi
when dog mentioned hingie, then when they tempted me
all up a nine milli', i brought my wild cousin billy
this fucking wu hater, from off of decatur
bout to get smacked silly, kinetic was like
yo, bobby, don't act illy, let me handle this shit
we rolled the candle sick spliff, we hopped inside the whip
and through the gear on shift, about to catch this vick

it's the season of the vick, bitch, you getting hit up
with so much weight, so much lead, you won't be able to get up

yo, kick in the door, spit a lungie at him, son, tried to bungie
grab 'em, through 'em on the floor, smacked 'em, my dudes bout to stab 'em
bitch was in the bathroom, screaming, hot bubble batch, steaming
you can tell from her face, she just finished swallowing semen
shut the fuck up, open the safe up, no time to waste up
heard you been hating on wu-tang, we should burn your fucking place up
he was like 'yo, bobby steels, chill, for real, please spare me'
billy put the gun to his face like 'bobby, go 'head, try to dare me'
i was like 'nah, son, chill, ain't necessary'
his bird was in the backround, still singing like a canary
told 'em, open up the safe or prepare for the mortiuary
when the gun starts to click, and we spit, that crazy scary
open it up, it was filled with drugs and jewelry and cash
and me, oh, i simply grabbed the digi
tied 'em up and gagged up, duct tape and paper bagged him
him and his bitch, in the whip, yup, we back in the magnum
return to the dread spread, gave him his cut of the bread
rumor has it, billy duffed them other cuts with dead

feel this,
to all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds for the
countless victims and all their families of
the murdered, tortured and slaved, raped, robbed and persecuted
never again, to the men, women, and children.
who died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.
reuven ben menachum, yo..

yo my own blood, dragged through the mud
perished in my heart still cherished and loved
stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
families cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide
tossed to the side, access denied
6 million died for what? yo a man shot dead in his back
helpless women and children under constant attack
for no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding
yo it's freezing, and men burn in hell, some for squeezing
no hope for a remedy, nothing to believe
moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body
late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty
having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions
deceived by the devils decisions, forced into a slave
death before dishonour for those men who were brave
shot and sent to their grave, can't awaken, it's too late
everything's been taken, i'm shaken, family, history, the making

never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
never again shall we sit and take orders
stripped of our culture, robbed of our name
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
forced from our families, taken from our homes
moved from our god then burned of our bones
never again, never again, shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
leave our sons and daughters, stripped of our culture
robbed of our name
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
forced from our families, taken from our homes
moved from our god and everything we own

some fled through the rumors of wars
but most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
with just one loaf of bread, banished, hold in for questioning
and vanished, never to be seen again, i can't express the pain
that was felt in the train to auschwitz, tears poured down like rain
naked face to face, with the master race, hatred blood and david
my heart belongs to god and stay sacred
rabbi's and priests, disabled individuals
the poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
mass extermination, total annihilation
shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
tortured and starved, innocent experiments
stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
the last hour, i smelled the flowers
flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
powerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest
crying, who would've guessed -- dying, another life lost
count the cost, another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust


never again, never again
the final solution is now retribution
remedy, wu-tang..

fire!

i remember bein' around wu and i'm like, um', "damn, they just like us." you know what i'm sayin', the, the raekwon remind me of this guy, ghost remind me of this guy around my way. it was like cousins almost, it was like, you know, project kids. that's what it-that was the language, project kids. we felt it, we smelt it off each other, and it just shows you, out of those housing projects come some brilliant people.

the special thing about wu-tang bein' eight or nine guys was, each one was a rapper who could represent their own individual self within that crew. they were the example for all of us, 'cause we haven't, we didn't really see that before, like more power to them, and show love to them, respect them, you know. they're honorable. they gave us incredible skill. they gave us incredible poetry. and they gave us music that no one's touchin' to this day. it's timeless.

we never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show

never let go of your mind
itâs a terrible thing to waste
to lose, but itâs very hard to find
being that ignorance is lethal
we must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
never let go of your plan, execute
so when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
never lose knowledge of yourself
for it may become risk to your health
and great loss of wealth

never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
players retire, but they never let go of the team

and memory of those who have passed to the other side
never letting go, iâm never letting go of my beliefs
my faith, convictions, real
both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
we hood legends, misunderstood
these lessons, learned
growing up for manhood
keep focus on the prize what you better do
a little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
states whatâs ahead of you, always on the schedule
smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
letting go, is something that i never do
those who let go, live life regrettable
never let go of your hope or your rope
eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
when iâm in jail, never let go of the soap
hold on, boy, never let go

never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
never let go your heart, or the place you started
the feeling that i had, wu-tang had just charted
the old earth departed, i give thanks to the martyrs
i never let go the love i have for thy father
never let go the glow
the more i know the more that it shows
i wonât let go, even if i decompose
your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
pass the baton, life is just the marathon
and ain't' playing to win it, itâs an epidemic
never let go, thatâs what the god recommended


and there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america. the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom

but that's actual, precise timed and on point like a marksman
four-four, rubber grip, summer of sam specialist
take this four-hunded grain thought that'll pierce ya cranium
from the rear, i don't give a fuck, this is my year
i'm takin this rap shit back from the wack
fuck who you are kid, fuck where you representin
and after, basically my mentality is on some '93 shit
when you had to protect ya neck in this shit
to be an mc, now it's al about the tight clothes
crossover flows, platinum jewelery to get a plaque in the industry
but never the i-s-l-o-r-d, i keep my shit muddy
stay gummy, ya fake ass gangstas

aiyyo

restrain cowards, pull out to the heat and flame at ours

aiyyo
a soviet deep in paris, playboy rabbits want carrots
luxury marriage, life, ain't havin it
i keep the forty-five automatic like mathematics
start terminatin savages, i'm raw like 'caine to easy addicts
street tactics, layin down the caskets
on biblical war, perform michael jackson thriller but way iller
a slave killer, protected by shaolin and brooklyn zu guerillas
under my pillow, i sleep with grenades, untraceable heaters
stay deeper than scientific readers
my cipher sounds will ding pound, i blast you on ya nightgown
kidnap ya child, might give him to the crowd
on my way uptown in my '95 millenium
seen killa sin and 'em, that nigga sound feminine
remember 9th prince, i'll forever get up in 'em

killa loco, vocals hold you hostage
gothic, size out live shit, catch a wise quick, focus
we stone fist explosive, load 'em like fo'-fifths
to roast clicks, ferocious as ro-bitch, with no cinch
my thoughts so dense they form mist
i swarm quicker than norm, my bee stingers stay dipped in corn liquor
warn niggaz from the last time, my past time hobby be
robbin niggaz in they lobby, g, come out ya wallabees
fifty-six penny-weight chain limit the policy

still gon' win from the streets cuz we ain't go no heat

and worry about that shit later
that's the general mentality out here kurt

you ain't hearin me
you wanna play this game
you can't cry when the game play you
yeah
ten g mics and shit

mics and men, books and pen
decent rhymes, hooks and lines
one time, where do we begin?
the gritty rugged lands of shaolin
where proud men went from moving crack rocks to moving mountains
moving crowds and making mothers proud now
walk out of places where our people wasn't allowed in
i took a high-hat, a snare, and a kick drum
a bass, a g-note, turned it into hit songs
now every we make forty gâs, nigga please, killa bees
pay a quarter mill for the emcees at night, aight?
i kick it like a nike flight
25 years later, who thought that we could be greater?
the name of wu-tang gets spread on both sides of the equator
the rzarector grew to be a movie director
still smoke blunts with the meth and rock mics with inspectah
still crash bars with shallah
and my brother devon, he still push the flyest cars
but he added a yacht to his repertoire
and they marvel how the jugger still caked with tony starks
while the rza and u-god still shake the fã©ru d'arts
cappadonna try to put a hole inside your heart
jamal ari push that chess piece across the board
with the sound of a sword bein' released from its sheath
and olâ dirty shimmy shimmy ya from beneath
and power still got that rugged gear in the streets
it's wu-tangs, mics and men, we killer bees
mathematics stay craft-matic on the beats

i'm in the mkx with the opposite sex
trying to take her from the suburb back to the projects
money, chicks, fast cars, that's my obsess
i ain't obligated to nothing except contracts
honey do you do dirty, niggas is still contacts
lovin' the babes daily, feedin' 'em blowback
canât let nothing walk by but a bubble ass
get money, pop bottles, then we double the cash
slip by the shop, other niggasâll fall back
see divine on the ocean in the yacht
flip money bags when our hulu shit pop
ferragamo belt with the gucci bought
yo, you can't tell me nothing bout the coogi, hah
when i was the one out there making the shit hot
when you was in the spot, you was just a young snot
i was in the ball game pitching the rock
wu-tang forever, we always on grind
like diddy told you, we ainât never gon' stop

man, have you not heard that one word given will have you missing
listen to the fly piano, wu-gambino soprano
deck and dino, owners of their own casino
rza keynote, stoudemire, young amar'e
flow hotter than the kalahari
skipping off the rim of the snare
every rhyme line rich without the line combined
with the power refined
see my mind shine brighter than einstein
shallah pen bleed then the dawn is my time
so run, tell a friend, you can check it on showtime
it's wu, mics and men

smokin bank in the corners in a black six-deuce
hittin switches, dippin, switchin on that ackrite juice

watch how fast these slugs in this thang gon' leave
watch how many holes in ya body it leaves
watch how much pints of blood you bleed
may the fake thugs retreat, pop up barkin the heat
caravanin nine-to-ten cars deep
down the 'shaw where knights is known to breakin laws
and if a bitch is ridin with me she's takin it off

smokin on a newport long and pcp
gat tucked in, easy pass, i'm low duckin
dimepiece bird on the side i'm finger-fuckin
bouncin off this deuce-deuces, fat like polo gooses
eighteen-inch woofers movin studio acoustics
rim tri-star, chrome on my side-bar
don't hate crab cuz i caught ya bitch eye par
platinum grill, re-enforced solid steel
superstar engine, force of an eighteen wheel
that'll crash through brick walls, smash intersections
move through ya city escorted with police protection
heated polished seats with back massages
you gotta know how to roll in more like kenny rogers
tinted glass, ps2 plus dreamcast
smoke screens, blindin high blasts
gps satellite navigation
automatic lock doors drop jackers to the station
you got beef you get fed to doc doom
goon, you can't fuck with wu killa bee clan platoon
i might get holocaust to come and cough on you
my nigga crisis might love to let one off on you
or rugged monk rolls up another blunt
the great digi goes and lures out another cunt
cuz i be rollin, rollin, rollin on them twenty-twos
ain't got no money or love for you funny fools
cuz i be rollin, rollin, rollin on them twenty-twos
sippin brews, packin tools for you funny fools

i'm from the land of chaos where niggaz get shot for trippin
i caught a fool slippin on some d's, now i'm steady dippin
cruisin, movin up the block cuz i'm the shit
stick dick to hoodrats, make gangsta hits
i baptize my sticks, ice skate on seventeens
on the phone with five-oh, don't you love them d's?
while they spin, you freeze in ya souped up paint clean
fifties, amps, six by nines and thangs
comin down the block, let my sub straight bang
like, "fuck the po-po's, i'm not turnin it down"
i love to floss as i toss up a fifth of that crown
bank corner after corners, watch all the ho's smile

yoyoyoyoyoyo! yo

niggaz ain't ready for this ok
one two whatcha wanna do (i'm gonna give it to em anyway though man)
peep the inspectah deck (you know they ain't ready for it)
lyrical threat
representing wu-tang
slang, ninety-five
hittin it live
you know what time it is

blessed with the art rhymes that's sharp like a circular saw
hit the floor like dorf, who wants the war
then slide by my, lyrical drive by
chops rush, making black hearts bust, plus knifes they got
when they rush, built like construction tools
crushing fools, in twos
forced dude to blast you out your fuckin shoes
a south swap with the bombs i drop
plan a to terrorize you can't stop the plot
execution of an amateur, who dared to challenge the
clansman, holding a sword like excalibur
truth is my shield, show and prove i reveal
reality, a coldness the heart can feel
livin life where caps peel, and crack deals from nine to five
but i survived in these hard times i nearly died
now i'm wanted by death i did escape
now it's thrown on a tape with those who can relate
still i wrap my face take a space in the staircase
hits takin place, yo god, watch the jakes
out of state court dates, chase me with the warrants
for my insurance, switched names to michael lawrence
the rebel, stomps through the slums i'm from
coming through with nuff niggaz, and nuff guns to bust son
so read the article, lyrical assassin with the arsenal
potential witnesses are incapable
of testifying, i won't be frying in the chair
plus the case closed, i won't be ever shackled, and safe clothes
i make foes, exasperates then, i make friends
cause today's friends, show theyselves as snakes in the end
and if you fit the trend then protect ya neck
shaolin, ins, killa hill projects

no one on this earth, can hold me
no one on this earth, can fool me
no one on this earth, can grip the mic
like, i, do, nigga

you ever, feel, that you can
test me, you got to face the clan and
never, return to the mic again
there's no one in the world

let me at them! i blast off lyrics like a magnum
forty-four caliber, bustin mad holes in my challenger
tongue in your throat is swiss cheese
the wild freestyler, wild like gene wilder
wu-tang killa bee aimed at your brain
with my stinger, it stun your mind, when i bring ya
thirty-six chambers of anger, frustration
for waiting, to let loose on the nation
far from commercial no need for no rehearsal
hit you from all angles then form a circle
go against the grain within close range
when i slam, like onyx, come get some, that's a promise
i'll represent, here's the evidence
science of mad murder plates i make sense
my technique of speech is deep, like leviathan
hittin up your block with rhymes, like a firing
shooting for the platinum, then bring it back to
the same place i got the gat from, let me at them


Yeah
Yo

Expedite lyrics under a godly spirit
Thoughts forced to hang-glide
Even a bird can hear it
A bald head with gold metal wings
Look like it belong in a day
The coming of Christ
Worshippin' the Elohim
That's the way I wear shades like CeeLo Green
It's darker than Don Cheadle
We're mean like his deleted scene
The prognosis, divine opus
Artistic third eye open, it leave you stuck in a psychosis
Or the haemo-tosis
Spit venom like a African cobra in the jungle
Knowin' my tongue is vulgar
I raise the Wu flag when they scream for glory
The clouds open, a beam of light, you hear my story
Custom-made scrolls, handwritten in coffee
And feather-tip pens one of the prophets brought me
And that explains why I spin on the axis
Born original, so my mind fades to blackness

Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith, so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith, so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pledge music, we came up from bringin' out club music
Acoustic jungle rap gave us all this project music
Blood in it, plug niggas get you mugged in it
Steel with steel, I'm finally out the drug business
Kneel proper for me, helicopter base, sage in it
Lessons from professors on stage winnin'
Nine swords, 36 Chambers
It's like a chess board, keep slidin'
Opponents get flamed on it
Trainin' poems, been the Game of Thrones
We been raised and grown
These young boys come through, spray your home
Facts, they gave me the ax, now lay it on me
Criminals have to eat, it's facts, shorty
You're damn right I go the square miles
We're from the stairs, thousands of pens could hear us from the rare sounds
Yeah, the Phoenix comin', ten Arabian Staten-adians
Who hooded up, known to get it bouncin'

Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith, so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith, so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Seen a lot of things
I can't live without my faith
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

First time I finally got with Wu, nobody really even knew what they looked like with the exception of, you know, that music video that I think they made for $10 for-for Method Man. But the problem was the business of Wu-Tang. They missed the photoshoot. The only photos they had, that I guess, featured them in masks. At the time, you know, this is pre-internet. If you missed the photoshoot, there was no way for a magazine to course correct. The magazine came out but instead of these photos, everybody had a basic, not even like an illustration, but a caricature. Raekwon the Chef, there was an illustration of Raekwon wearing like a chef hat. Ol' Dirty Bastard is pictured with a blow up doll. I didn't like 'em but the thing was-was I completely understood the position that they were put in. Without art we would have to kill the story. I didn't think the illustrations reflected the seriousness of what I witnessed. Cause musically Wu-Tang was just off the charts. I thought it looked corny. Some stories turn out great and some stories don't turn out great. This was the one I felt was only okay and um you move on. It came out and nothing happened. I didn't hear anything from the group
First person that I see, Masta Killa walks up, I didn't know him at the time. And he say "Yo, is you Cheo?" And I said "Yeah." Bam, I get hit in the face. He's right 'cross my left eye. "That's just to let you know Wu-Tang Clan nothing to fuck with. We come real with our shit. We ain't no fuckin' cartoon characters."

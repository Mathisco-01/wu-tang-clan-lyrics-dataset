Girl youâve got to know that youâll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
âCause baby youâre the one
Tonight Iâm taking off so I can make time
For the one, âcause youâre the one, the only one
Baby youâre the one

[Ghostface Killah:]
(Yo, yo, yo)
Floor seats roll five at the Barclays
My girl's physical she wanna see Beyonce
Lipstick from hugging me close, it's on the collar
Tomorrow night dear, we gonna crash the Oscars
Shout-out to my L.A. jeweler for the chandelier 'round her neck
Yeah, my baby's the best
Her credit line is like RZA and [?] combined
She can ride off the lot at the drop of a dime
Rozay minks, matching Diors
I cop that shit overseas on tours
No makeup, when she wake up
Sweatpants and the fat ass, boxed braids, watch where she laced up
She be in the kitchen like Patti LaBelle
With a bunch of jokes all day like Dave Chappelle
A checkbook queen who had a manager well
And a bedroom, she be doin' in, doin' it well

[Steven Latorre:]
Girl youâve got to know that youâll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
âCause baby youâre the one
Tonight Iâm taking off so I can make time
For the one, âcause youâre the one, the only one
Baby youâre the one

[RZA:]
Look me in my eye and lie to me again
Tell me I'm your only lover, your best friend
Tell me that this moment we have would never end
Look me in my eye and lie to me again
She had a couch in the library
And a bed that led to a cemetery
Yeah, shorty had money to call an Audi
I was hard as a brick as she iPhone record me
Put on iCloud, let TMZ report me
Oh, what a girl, what a world she bought me
When our lips touch, she like cig puffs
Bustin' like a rocket to the moon or bust
This is past, past [?], past infatuation
This just like she was my soul aspiration
She's the type who likes sex over masturbation
And tonight, I'm gearing up full ejaculation
Like...

[Steven Latorre:]
Girl youâve got to know that youâll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
âCause baby youâre the one
Tonight Iâm taking off so I can make time
For the one, âcause youâre the one, the only one
Baby youâre the one

[Cappadonna:]
You're like the early-in-the-morning spring flower that blossomed to a rich, delicate, high-pitched colorful skin tone acrylic
Let me gorilla it
You think I'm feeling shit
But if you just shit and listen to the way that I spit
Stimulated off the way that you switch
Illustrious wisdom
Queen of the Seven Seas
Why you makin' me appear to be mean?
I speak from the root of our self-esteem
Let me embrace that
Holding you captive
You're so attractive
So let me taste that
And beat it up real good until you say cat
You're not a hood rat
You're from a good batch
Your intellect reflects light that make the people unite
You got flavor like Michelle, Barack
You're high maintenance
And your shell is black
You speak languages

[Steven Latorre:]
Girl youâve got to know that youâll always be my only one
The only one, the only one, the only one
âCause baby youâre the one
Tonight Iâm taking off so I can make time
For the one, âcause youâre the one, the only one
Baby youâre the one

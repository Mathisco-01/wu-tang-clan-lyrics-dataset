[Masta Killa:]
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop

[Raekwon:]
Cash rules everything around me, I'm fresh out the slum
Rich bum nigga, now I live dumb
Talking 'bout that cream leaning in the tower
[?] got condos in the jungle
The mind stay rich but the pockets is well-filled
Let's violate this lil' area, get milk
I'm telling you, man, you don't want no part of this, fam
Get punched in the water like clamps
KKK, slices, they one of the nicest
Stainless steel, sharp swords, dipped in ricin
Everybody eating, everybody full
Just a young bull lighting a Philly, still a willy
Ball on 'em in the Bentley with the wall on 'em
Yo, I'll sleep when I'm dead, like the hood, homies
Who get it cracking in the park homes?
[?] kill narco, smoke and let the bones turn to charcoal
Let's get richer, kid
Signature Luis rich won't stop until there's billions in this bitch

[Masta Killa:]
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop

[Method Man:]
I grew up on the rhyme side, that "gotta get mine" side
That white girl, we mix it with quinine
You players try and ball from the sidelines
While I'm aging like fine wine, you internet thuggin somebody timeline
Between love and hate is a fine line
In these habitual line steppers can die trying
A New York calendar, my clicks and [?]
A pocket full of that white Nix for my client
Y'all ain't buying, stop crying and stop lying
Hakuna Matata, no Mufasa, I'm not lion
You try to spit on that hot iron, you not [?]
The irony 'cause that last shot, you shot [?]
So let's start it with this, son, motivate him with this one
You ain't got no haters, go get some
Is anybody greater? There is none
Assorted 'Now And Laters', my clan got too many flavors to pick from

[Masta Killa:]
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop

[Inspectah Deck:]
Deuce high when I start my game
It's like [?] y'all, all you see is sparks and flames
I grab bags and I park my ways, the way I have 'em all locked
You would think they gave they heart to [?]
Bet on us, baby, ain't no better odds to play
It's hard to fake, my real life is on display
Either love or hate whatever part you play
I take the best of both worlds like R. and Jay
Own boss, no third party
Produce more murder than Irv Gotti
Like I'm working on my third body
Deck, kill it quick
24/7 bed rest, that's how ill it get
Can't stop if I mash the brakes
Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
[?] got me floating like I'm trapped in space
Not safe for your workplace, a basket case

[Masta Killa:]
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money not, hammer cock, curry hot
Cuck a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weight it up
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money not, hammer cock, curry hot
Cuck a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weight it up
Quest to success with my mind on my money
Came a new rhyme saying "Wu-Tang is the best"
Music

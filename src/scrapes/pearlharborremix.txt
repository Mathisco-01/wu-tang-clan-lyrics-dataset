[Ghostface Killah:]
Form better niggas, club night, no sparkles
Forty wolves on deck with burners in their snorkel
Criminology, pea soup Wallabees
Ghostface Killahs with degrees in gynecology/gun-ecology (Yeah)
Shoot your old lady in her privacy (Word)
A bunch of ho-ho-hoes wanna ride with me (Go Santa)
I'm caught up in these strong-arm robberies
Flee with the lottery, these pussy niggas shot at me

[Method Man:]
Since, birth, I've been a fast learner, ask my earth
That's my mama, kept a burner in her purse
This murder in the first
Whatcha thought, that was the gift? That's the curse
I put everythang on it, that's 'The works'
I'm in it for the perks
'Cause it's not about the image, it's the thirst
And how they kill your image with a verse
A hater get it worse
I'm telling every member of your church
They gon' have to put your image on a shirt
'Til I finish my dessert, nobody eatin'
That's everybody, I mean anybody
I might leave somebody bleedin'
Or watch me catch a homi', even hit you in the lobby
Shotty pop ya like a molly, probably leave you hardly breathin'
Don't try to Blaze with Johnny even if you got an army
Dirty money in the laundry, don't ask why, I got my reasons
I puff that Bob Marley, might hit you with the Tommy
You can catch me in the party near the speaker not speakin'

[Sean Price:]
Yo, you ever been face-fucked with a four-fifth?
Sweating, facial expression is stressing like 'oh shit'
That's the shit that I don't like
Non-rappin' rappers in the booth and they don't write
Fuckin' stupid ass rappers
Acting out of their character, I shoot and stab rappers
P! What it do, nigga?
I fucks with Wu-Tang and a couple of new niggas
I don't weirdo with queer clothes
I share flows, when it enter your earhole
Shit, it's a thing of pure beauty
Everything that's spittin' is written by yours truly
Nigga, when Sean write hard
Niggas do anything for it like Klondike Bars
Pa, I'm the greatest of all-time
How should we forget the latest with Alzheim's?

[Pharoahe Monch:]
Merciless with the flow with the spit I'm ridiculous
I do not lick chicks, I do the beatbox on they clitorous
Like (imitating beatbox sounds)
The God represents Sun, Earth, Moon, Star
A beast on all fours, smack your chick on her keister
The conquistador rockin' the mink on Easter
Never cease to amaze the crowd, a speech to famine [?]
When I talk on Instagram, they won't be shootin' you with no cannon
Smile, give 'em Candid Camera
You verses The God is Godzilla verses Gamera
Anama [?], cannibal with animal instincts
Think Hannibal with the elephants channeling six tanks
New York nigga 'bout to slick quicker-picker-upper stick
Dick her sister down, take the picture, get the number, click
Pick six hitter [?] for the whole team
But the stick is still in the window, the sickest nigga from Queens
Break it down

[Tek:]
Trill nigga but I ain't gotta say it
The way that I move, how I display it
I talk less and I listen more
Usually about the slow booth with Chef [?] raw
Been throwin' barrels to niggas' medullas
Since Slick Rick been rappin', while he was the ruler (Once Upon A Time)
Graduated school of hard knocks when your mama was doin' things for hard rocks
N.W.A. back in the day, O'Shea
Let the AK go in your face
Drumroll
Standing Ovation, Thug 1-O-1 was my motivation

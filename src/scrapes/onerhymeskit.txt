[GZA:]
The remedy for stress is a day and a rest
A bag of sess, playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't looking, I take the queen with the rook then
I get vexed, laying phat tracks on Ampex

[Masta Killa:]
I was basically leaving the hustle life. You know, going to night school striving to get a diploma and transitioning to a legitimate lifestyle. That's what my life was like at that point when I met GZA. He mentioned he had family and brothers in Staten Island that were putting this movement together, this Wu-Tang thing. So one day he invites me to go to the studio with him. I didn't go because I had to go to night school that evening. So the next day he had a tape of what they did the night before. And that tape was an unfinished version of "Protect Yo Neck." When I heard that, everything just became crystal clear now. I never missed another studio session after that. Whenever he told me he was going somewhere I was there. It inspired me to sit down. Let me just see if I can write something. I've never written a rhyme before this. So that's what I did. I basically rehearsed that one rhyme, that one rhyme until I mastered it 

"You remember the rhyme?"

It was the "Mystery of Chessboxin'" one
